<p><strong>Marquin Writes:</strong></p>
<p><em>Alright, so, I&rsquo;ll start off with a simple question&ndash;how does one go about getting a job as a software engineer at EA? I hate to come off as arrogant, however, I have learned that this may be the only chance I have&ndash;every person trying to get a job &ldquo;fluffs up&rdquo; their resume, advertising skills they dont really have. Thus, on a resume, I am the same as anyone else, because even though I may be honest about my skills, I look no different on a resume than someone whos fluffed theirs up. I know that EA must get thousands of job applications and resumes on a weekly basis. My question is: how does one get noticed? I think that there are 2 kinds of programmers&ndash;those that do it for the money, and those that were born with the skill. I am the latter. Even when entering college, I already had more programming and software engineering skills than most PROFESSORS (I wont even compare with the students). Again I&rsquo;m sorry to be so arrogant, but I feel it is the only way to set myself apart. So, even though I may be a more talented and skilled software engineer than most 10-20 year veterans, I am immediately labeled as the &ldquo;college newbie&rdquo; who has &ldquo;no software engineering skills&rdquo; and couldnt write robust code if my life depended on it. In fact, I dont blame them for thinking this&ndash;when I see the other students in my class, even those who love to program, I would also put most of them in that category. My question is&ndash;HOW DOES ONE STAND OUT? How can I show EA that I have what it takes, that I can work with their best. If I had to, I would work for them for FREE for a MONTH just to be able to show them this: whatever it takes. I know that having the right networks count, and that I would have no problem getting a job there if my sisters boyfriends dads cousins boyfriend was a senior software engineer. But I truly believe that if only I could show them my skills, show them that I can solve anything they dish out at me with style and robustness, that they would give me a chance&ndash;if only. Any help anyone could give me would be truly appreciated.</em></p>

<p>The best way to stand out is to be a good networker. But&hellip;I&rsquo;ve beat that drum enough&ndash;I&rsquo;ll let you search these forums for ideas on how to do that. Besides that you should write a game. Either write one on your own, or if you aren&rsquo;t interest in game design you should partner with a group writing a MOD or someone else who can provide the design and art side of things. Having a really good demo is going to be a great tool for you to make a good impression when you finally land some face time with the right people. Few things say &ldquo;I will make a good games programmer&rdquo; than &ldquo;I have written 3 games that use the technology you work with.&rdquo; Finally, theres nothing wrong with being confident, but arrogance will get the door shut in your face in this industry. People here are badass but they also place a high value on modesty. If you are a badass you need to show it by what you accomplish (i.e. writing a game).</p>

<p>Removed the link to Marquin&rsquo;s email, I figure he doesn&rsquo;t want to keep hearing from people through this page nor be exposed to more spam.</p>
