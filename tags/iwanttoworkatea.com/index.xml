      <title>My Theory On Tetris</title>
      <link>https://ggr.com/my-theory-on-tetris.html</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve done my share of dabbling in neurobiology literature and within said literature is information about our eyes. We dont perceive the world as a raw stream of color and brightness&amp;ndash;we see objects that retain their integrity even as we turn our heads or they move around. Anyone whos written AI visual navigation/targeting systems can attest to what an impressive ability this is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our eyes and brain dont do this in one step. Much like a programer uses functions to organize code at different levels of abstraction so too our brain constructs the visual world in layers. First there are points, then lines, then other constructs like right-angles, and parallel lines. There are actually brain cells that detect parallel lines. All these primitives are used to form ever more complicate objects until we can look in a room and quickly identify a chair as a chair rather than a bunch of pixels impacting our retina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect that we take a certain pleasure in symmetry, parallels, right-angles, and perfect fits because of the way our brain organizes visual primitives. Tetris is a game where you manipulate pieces formed of right angles such that new parallels and perfect fits are created. Movement and tension is transformed into harmony and restover and over. Its the visual equivalent of playing a dominant chord then its tonic. Maybe there is something to Feng Shui after all&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Problem With Mr. Evil</title>
      <link>https://ggr.com/the-problem-with-mr.-evil.html</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Maybe its just me, but I&amp;rsquo;m getting tired off all the comic book evil that we have in games these days. Whether youre playing KotOR or Fable youll notice that when you decide to veer to the dark side of the force its pretty obvious that what you are doing is evil . That is to say comic book evil&amp;ndash;no grays here, pretty much anyone on the planet would judge the evil action as such. But evil in the real world is all about the shades of grey where otherwise good people keep pushing the boundaries of propriety one inch at a time all the while rationalize and justifying their actions. Its subtle and insidious. And its much more seductive and powerful than what I&amp;rsquo;m finding in games that offer the choice between good and evil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evil people dont think they are evil. An evil player should feel the same way. It creates some interesting dilemmas for game designers&amp;ndash;when you are dealing with grays one mans grey is anothers white and another mans black. The grey zone is the area most open to debate and calling something evil or good in that area requires taking a sort of stand. But hell, were already doing it with black and white, why not grey? Would be a lot more fun.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Hollywood Eye</title>
      <link>https://ggr.com/the-hollywood-eye.html</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 07 Nov 2004 22:56:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ggr.com/the-hollywood-eye.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;While chowing down on workday lunches I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0060391138/qid=1099891783/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/104-4386696-2656740?v=glance&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;n=507846&#34;&gt;The Hollywood Eye&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s a book about what makes films enjoyable, moving, and generally impactful. Actually it&amp;rsquo;s the observations about what doesn&amp;rsquo;t work and why is the part most applicable to games&amp;ndash;there are a lot of ways to take the player out of the game just as there are ways to take the viewer out of a movie. Game designers have the added complication of satisfying the desires of the player without complete control over what happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the book there are 3 eyes: voyeuristic, vicarious, and visceral. Each is a sort of enjoyment center of our brains, if you will, which has an appetite for different aspects of the stories we experience. The voyeuristic eye is looking for spectacle, logic, beauty, and the new experience. It enjoys the visual for it&amp;rsquo;s own sake and it is quickly bored. The vicarious eye wants an emotional connection so it can be transported to new emotional vistas from the safety of it&amp;rsquo;s own life. It&amp;rsquo;s concerned with how genuine the emotions and action of the characters are and it has all the time in the world as long as the emotions are right. The visceral eye is the part that likes shock, gut-wrenching, and a physical reaction to the scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first glance games would appear to be well suited good at satisfying the voyeuristic eye&amp;ndash;we have lots of eye candy to go around and since all our sets are created from scratch its almost easier to take the player to a new world. However, our players are used to being transported to new lands and are a bit jaded to the effect. On top of that, the voyeuristic eye is quickly bored and with the player in control of the pacing its hard to keep the voyeuristic eye satisfied. Alice and Grim Fandango do pretty well at this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The visceral eye would be my next bet for one games could tackle&amp;ndash;and I think this one is managed on occasion, though its not as easy to impact the gut through a TV sized screen. Nonetheless&amp;ndash;with the player in control there are some opportunities to really surprise the player with a monster or an unexpected even. More often then not games undermine this greatly by sucking us out with NISes. Id be hard pressed to find a game that does this better than Fatal Frame. Play it with the lights out, alone, at 2a if you dont believe me. System Shock 2 deserves an honorable mention in this category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vicarious eye is the hardest one for games, I think. Most games cast the player as the main character limiting their potential as an emotional backdrop. And since the other characters the player interacts with are nowhere as real as the player is, it hard to develop the sort of emotional connection that would interest the vicarious eye. I mean, when was the last time you &lt;em&gt;cared&lt;/em&gt; about an NPC in one of these thingsor shared an emotional connection with one? Its an interesting limitation of the medium. The closest I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten recently is with, oddly enough, Full Spectrum Warrior. I felt responsible for my men as if they were peopleknowing that this training is used by real soldiers made me think that I should take this very, very seriously just as if I were a soldier. One of my men getting shot wasn&amp;rsquo;t just something I could reload&amp;ndash;someday this could be real!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whats struck me most about this book is how it has equipped me to evaluate games and understand why they didnt work for me when I previously relied on intuitive tools alone. I&amp;rsquo;m interested in seeing how I can apply these ideas to game design. Good stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Key Programming Skill: Finishing</title>
      <link>https://ggr.com/the-key-programming-skill-finishing.html</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scott Writes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just graduated from Cal Poly with a Computer Engineering Bachelors degree. I took a computer graphics course using java3d which I really enjoyed. I&amp;rsquo;m trying to figure out what Id need to do to be attractive to Electronic Arts as a game programmer . I&amp;rsquo;ve been entertaining getting a masters degree in computer graphics at UC Davis, but am thinking maybe there is more straight forward approach. I commend you on the amount of networking you did to get into the company. Id like to get some advice from you or someone you think could help me to figure out how to get from where I am now to designing outstanding video games. I have just started a firmware engineering job in which I&amp;rsquo;ll be doing heavy C and assembly language coding. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping I can put together a plan, perhaps a custom masters degree specified by EA? What do you think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId=70144/&#34;&gt;Steve&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s Reply:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The masters degree is certainly a leg up, although Davis is not one of our regular recruiting grounds. I vaguely remember hearing something about them improving their program though. I used to be the EA Campus Recruiting Manager for Cal Poly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C++ is definitely where youd want to focus (C use is rapidly dwindlingwere starting to use C# for tools, and rendering microcode is just about all we have left thats done in assembly).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best thing you can do, in my experience (and keep in mind: I am a hiring manager), is make a game of your own or a demo that clearly shows that you would add value to a team making a game. This is a good way to prove a couple of things that we look for in people: the ability to finish something - which they typically do NOT teach in school&amp;ndash;and initiative, which it seems one either has or does not. If you can get artists involved you can show another desirable trait, which is the ability to speak to someone who is not either a machine or an engineer. This is frighteningly uncommon in computer types, but its becoming more and more of a necessity the way the business works. If you can do all that, your degrees will become a bit secondary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You (the other Scott, the one I dont know) speak of both programming and design. Keep in mind that the two are separate disciplines at EA, although engineers definitely have participation and input into design. Like that guy at the end of the first Half-Life, you have to choose. {smile} Programming is a lot more work, but its also true that unless youre an absolute superstar designer (think Will Wright) youll make more money - and arguably, the designers that do make piles of money are also programmers (Carmack, Wright, Cerny, Molyneaux, Meier).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>From Psychology To Games</title>
      <link>https://ggr.com/from-psychology-to-games.html</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Todd Writes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hi. I&amp;rsquo;m considering changing careers but I&amp;rsquo;m not sure about the best way to do it. After graduating a few years ago with a doctorate in clinical psychology, I obtained a faculty position at a major university, where I now work as a clinician and researcher . While I have been successful thus far in my area of study, I have made a decision to pursue a career in game design and development. I have some experience in managing large projects, so I might be able to apply for a project director type of position, but I&amp;rsquo;m most interested the artistic end of game design. I am considering taking a certification course in 3D character design and animation at the university where I currently work. But I dont want to spend the money, or begin transitioning from my current position, if my chances of being able to break into the industry are slim to none. I&amp;rsquo;m sure to be competing with students who have had much more experience in computing and art than I could ever hope to obtain at this point in my life (even though I&amp;rsquo;m only 30). Do you think my training in psychology, and the skills that I have developed as a clinical research scientist will be desired by a game company? What type of additional training would you recommend? How much experience do most new hires (those individuals who are fresh out of college or internship) have in the area of 3D character design? I&amp;rsquo;m wondering if a 9-month intensive course would be sufficient to compete. Are there any jobs that I might be suited for in this industry? Any advice would be very much appreciated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Reply:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure generally speaking, but I know that my team is working on a game that has some crossover with psychology and animation&amp;ndash;if we had the opportunity to hire an intern that was equipped to bridge the gap it would be an interesting option. So I imagine there opportunities for someone like you to actually apply the skills you have already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, EA&amp;rsquo;s not the sort of company to compensate someone based on their potential&amp;ndash;you will have to prove yourself first. The most important thing is to get a positionany position (project manager if thats easiest, for example), at EA and then go from there. EA pays for a bunch of schooling while you are an employee as a benefit, so once you are in you have a much easier time of talking to people about what you need to learn, taking those classes, and then having access to the positions you want. Its &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; easier from the inside.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;James Writes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[For internships at EA] I noticed that the applicant pool consists of about 720 students, and they only take in around 60. I had a question as to where most of these internship applications and opportunities fall . And also if 720 or so applicants consist of both high school students, current college students, and college grads.or just grads. Also, if you could tell me how many internships do they offer in the Marketing/PR department for the summer. This will help my gauge my odds of getting in.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.linkedin.com/pub/phillip-gee/0/894/415&#34;&gt;Phil&lt;/a&gt; Replies:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bulk of our internships especially in the marketing area tend to fall in the summer. It&amp;rsquo;s the busiest period for EA. Last summer we had approximately, 20-25 internships allocated to the marketing team. Within that 20-25, roughly 20% were MBA s and the rest were undergrads. I would anticipate having the same number for this coming summer. To be eligible for the internship program, you must be a student enrolled in an accredited university. Beginning with this summer s intern class, students who have graduated from school will no longer be eligible to apply for an internship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I am interviewing for a Desktop Support position on Monday for EA Tiburon in Orlando. Is there any advice you can give me? I&amp;rsquo;ve also been told there will be a written technical assessment. I was looking at your game design questionaire and was wondering if it would reflect any of those kinds of questions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Reply:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve never had a technical assessment since I haven&amp;rsquo;t applied for a position where it would be appropriate. Cant be too much help there. That said, my advice is to get business cards from everyone you interview with (or at least get their contact info if they are not carrying cards). If you get the gig it won&amp;rsquo;t be as useful, but if you dont hit it out of the ballpark on your first attempt youll have a handful of new contacts that will likely give you the time of day if you call them and ask what you could do better next time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Programming vs Art Production</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jeff Writes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I hope you know someone in the Arts/Textures/Graphics department at EA that can answer a question for me. I currently attend Ohio State where I am studying Computer Science and Engineering. During the course of my major (which I begin in less than a month), I will have the opportunity to take a number of graphics courses, though all of these courses are centered in building graphics through the C language, at least from what I&amp;rsquo;ve been told. I have recently become aware of a smaller school in Ohio that offers a Game and Simulation Development degree that concentrates on the &amp;ldquo;arts/theatre/graphical elements&amp;rdquo; of game design. I want to work my way up the ladder and be a game designer in the future. Given EA&amp;rsquo;s way of creating a games graphics (whatever that way is), would a programming intensive background, or the above Game Development background serve me better?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Reply:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few game designers that I&amp;rsquo;ve met at EA have extensive CS training, but thats not necessarily a good thing&amp;ndash;there are some definite advantages to designers who understand how to build what they are designing. Having a solid knowledge of C and C++ will open more doors at EA than would a knowledge of art production IMHO and the first thing you need to do at EA is get in any way you can&amp;ndash;you can find your way to becoming a designer much more easily from the inside than the outside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;hi my name is stephan i want to know if it is possible for me to make my own xbox videogames on my computer if so what software do i need and whatt are the steps to making the games like graphics and game modes and create player etc&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Reply:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making games for the Xbox is an expensive endeavor requiring thousands of dollars of equipment and software from Microsoft. And since writing for the PC isnt all that different from writing for the Xbox I would suggest that you focus your efforts on the PC instead. Visual Studio + the DirectX SDK from Microsoft are the programming tools of choice but VS is expensive (DirectX works with VS and is free). You can find freeware tools that are like Visual Studio that will enable you to write games that make use of the free DirectX SDK and I suggest you locate one of those. C++ is the language most games are made with, but if you dont need extensive multimedia support (as you might not with a board game) then you will find Visual Basic a good language to learn with and make your game. There are a number of books available from Amazon that teach how to make video games. You should buy one or check one out from your library.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rudy Writes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I was reading some stuff on your website and just want to say, it&amp;rsquo;s a really cool idea. Congrats on landing the job with EA! I was wondering if I could get your opinion on something, from someone who has been through the interview process before , I really value your opinion.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Last week at Siggraph I dropped off my reel /resume at the EA booth. The next day they brought me in for an interview at the convention. I have no idea how many people they brought in, but I was excited nonetheless. The interview felt pretty informal and didnt last any longer than 20 min, but i felt it went well.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I was wondering, If they ask questions like, Which division would you prefer to work at, Do you have any salary requirements? and then they wrote down my availability date as Oct 07. Are these good signs that I may have a chance to interview with them further? or is this basic stuff they ask everyone and it doesnt mean anything. Anyway, I told them Id prefer to work at Tiburon studios in Orlando, so well see what happens, come October. =]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oh yeah, I noticed on your &amp;ldquo;People I&amp;rsquo;ve talked to page&amp;rdquo; you had Stephanie Ross listed, thats who I talked to too. She was the one who contacted me to tell me they wanted to bring me in for an interview. I failed to get the name of the recruiter from Tiburon who I interviewed with, all I know is that it was a woman, Do you have any suggestions on how I could find it out? Should I just wait until October, or call Stephanie/Tiburon before then?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Any insight you could give me will be appreciated, I have some follow up questions too, so looking forward to hearing from you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Reply:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have someone you can call to figure out whats going on, it&amp;rsquo;s a good idea to follow up. I dont know what the questions you got indicate. I was asked similar questions for a position I did not get an offer for but I stayed in touch with my interviewers and they helped me meet other people at EA that eventually did offer me a job. Once you have a toe in the door use it!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stephan Writes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;my name is stephan i am 12 and i have an idea for a game mode on live 2005 it is called become an nba star .it is when you create a player then select his position, home town,school and,statistics, you can create his family members so they can be there on draft day.then what he will wear on draft day and a voice cause he will narate his career and how he feels.then show david stern announcing the last pick of the draft and show him going up getting his cap and shakingf his hand.then teams will start acalling you on your cell phone asking you to play in the summer leage teams during the games scouts from other teams will look at you and at the end of the summer leauge games teams will call you offering contracts.then you will decide what team to accept the contract from. the people would have left callback numbers on your decision.you  will start on the bench you only will get a couple of minutes a game.then by about the 3rd game the star player at your position will get hurt at a practice then the coach will aproach you telling your the starter. but whe you are one the bench you can accelorate the time  untill you are put on the bench.when you create a player you will be asked to put you complete name bet so it can be said buy the copmmentators a list of names that can be pronounced by the commentators you can press a button to see how the names sound.you also have the option to develope naturally by game or earn points toward an attribute. over the course of years if you become a good player you will be called by endorsers.soon you will be able to design your own clothes,shoes,headbands,etc.once your contrac tis over you will be offered another one or be released.you will also earn a nickname from your most popular teammate based on the way you play.soon you will be able to buy cars houses clothes,etc but at the start you have to pick from the stuff you can afford based on your salary the more money you make the better stuff you can buy.you will eventually you wll be having press confrences.dont worry,you will have time to type in answers to questions they ask you pretty soon you will get to see your self on tv and hear what other coaches and players have to say about you and your game .at the end you will et up a press confrence announcing yoor retirement.the in acouple of year wich will be simulated based on how much money you have left you can buy one of the most domonate teams that have become bad (at this point it would have auto switched to franchise mode).if you could geta chance to give this to to the creator of live 2005 and see if he likes it. (if he likes it and can get all this done and add some stuff to it. you can take all the credit if he doesnt like it you can say you got it from a kid who wants to work at ea when he gets older&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Reply:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cool idea! I think you should start a discussion on a games site1s forums about it and see what the other fans think. The creators of all these games read forums to learn what people like and dislike about the game so they can make the next version even better. If you can get a lot of people talking about your idea, you never know&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless, definitely write this one down and start a game idea folder. It will be a really great thing to have years down the road when you are making games of your own. And you dont have to wait for programming skills to do ityou could even turn this idea into a board game or a card game. Believe it or not, a lot of computer games use the same concepts that board games use&amp;ndash;they just have better graphics on top. If you can make a board game that captures the fun of &amp;ldquo;become an NBA star&amp;rdquo; then you would really have something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BTW, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sloperama.com/advice/idea.htm&#34;&gt;here&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; a great article on how to take your game ideas forward. Good to hear from you and good luck!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Advice For an Intern</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stefan Writes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hey Scott, My name is Stefan Stignei and I&amp;rsquo;m going to be a sophomore next year at OSU. I&amp;rsquo;m majoring in New Media Communications and minoring in Commnunications. I&amp;rsquo;m also going to be a Resident Assistant in my hall which I&amp;rsquo;m really pumped for because I love meeting new people and would like to help them out.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anyway I would love to work for a video game company. I&amp;rsquo;m going to apply for an internship at EA Games this year and I am wondering if there is anything I need to know about the work. I&amp;rsquo;m interested in Production and Marketing/Public Relations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Reply:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What can I tell you, its a ton of fun and its a ton of work! :) Passion, energy, and an eagerness to do anything and everything in your power to help your team succeed will take you far in any profession, but its especially important to interns that want to go permanent in the game industry. I suggest you bring a great attitude, work hard, and do your best to enjoy the wild ride should you land an internship at EA. And be sure and shoot me an email when you start your internship at EA and I&amp;rsquo;ll buy you lunch. :)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Game Industry Pay and College Plans</title>
      <link>https://ggr.com/game-industry-pay-and-college-plans.html</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Justin Writes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hi, my name is Justin I. I live in southern part of California. I am only 14
years old but I am serious to pursue this kind of job. I&amp;rsquo;ve made maps for games
like counter-strike , Medal Of Honor, Call Of Duty, and some more. I am
currently working as a mapper for a Half-Life 2 mod called Insects Infestation.
I dont know what its like to work at ea, or if its good pay. Also what college
is fit for this. EA is one of my favorite game brands, I like mostly first
person shooters, like the battlefield series. I&amp;rsquo;m waiting for the new one to
come out ;). It would mean very much to me if you can answer my questions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Reply:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justin, You are doing exactly the right thing making maps, mods (man, when is HL2
going to come out I can hardly wait anymore!!), and games showcases your passion
and ability both of which will take you far. EA&amp;rsquo;s compensation is very good when
you include stock, bonuses, benefits, and its other forms. The game industry
pays engineers slightly less that they can make writing, for example, accounting
software, but artists are often paid better while making games than they are in
other pursuits. You&amp;rsquo;ll find that some mid-sized game companies pay more than EA
to compensate for their less competitive track record, resources, and career
opportunities and that just makes for some interesting and occasionally tough
career choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for college, you should study your butt off and get into the best 4 year
college you can. Game makers benefit from having a broad education. Not only do
the people who made Medal of Honor have a knowledge of the technical aspects of
game making, but they also know a thing or two about history, literature,
politics, physics, and psychology. Games touch all sort of fields of study and
the people who excel in this industry often have specialized skills supported by
a well-rounded education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Justin Writes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thank you lots. a couple questions I forgot, If I want to be in the map/model
(3d) part of the game industry, what is that position called? And do you know
any particular college I should intend? - half-life 2 has been haunting me for
the last couple months, I cant wait to play it, with its physics and graphics. I
am also waiting for the sdk to come out, so I can start working on the hl2
hammer. What do you do for EA and how is it working there? I&amp;rsquo;ve watched shows on
the process showing what crimson Skys for xbox was going through, hard work, but
it looks fun to work in that kind of environment. which EA do you work at? and
what do you do? I tried looking for someone that works at ea for a long time
[-that emails me back-] haha. glad I finally found a person.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Reply:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mappers are called &amp;lsquo;Level Designers&amp;rsquo; in the industry. You should go to the best
college you can get into&amp;ndash;Harvard and MIT are always good picks. ;) You want to
go to the best college for your area of interest and don&amp;rsquo;t worry about whether
it&amp;rsquo;s good for the game industry. A general computer science degree from MIT will
get you further in the game industry than any game focused program at a lesser
college. You can read some more in-depth advice &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sloperama.com/advice/designprep.htm&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. As for me and what I
do, you can check all that stuff out on my blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated on October 22, 2015:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Redacted Justin&amp;rsquo;s last name by his request. Fixed some typos too.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Albert Writes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;My name is Albert, and I first want to thank you on having a great website. It&amp;rsquo;s very helpful to those who are planning on joining EA and need some advice on what to expect and what is expect of you. I have several questions I need to ask. I would like to know if you have heard any information about EA expanding their office in Orlando, Fl. I am in the process of getting my BA in Computer Animation , and I hear that EA is building an academy at the University of Central Florida. Will the professors be EA employees? What requirements (skills) are needed in order to intern as an animator at EA? When submitting my portfolio what materials would I include? Does one need to have excellent drawing skills to be considered for a 3d animation position. I work full time and I go to school full time, so it is hard to concentrate on both drawing and animation. I usually stick to animation: even though, drawing does give me the vision and perspective to do my animations. How were you able to network with so many people who worked at EA? Did you come in contact with them before or after you joined EA? If you can give me some tips I would greatly appreciate it. I do apologize for the bombardment of questions, but I am very interested in becoming an EA employee.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Reply:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi Albert, I haven&amp;rsquo;t heard anything in particular about a Florida expansion, but I cannot claim to be in the loop on that subject. I can tell you that EA is growing apace with the interactive entertainment industry in general, which is roughly 20% a year. I read an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gamespot.com/articles/florida-woos-ea-with-game-development-academy/1100-6100195/&#34;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; talking about Floridas courting of EA so it would seem we would have good reason to expand there, but who knows? Regarding networking into EAI didnt know anyone at the company before I began my game industry focused networking efforts. I talk about how I did it in my blog (in fact, it documents much of what I was doing as I was doing it)you can find a ton of good ideas to get you started there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To answer your questions about UCF and animation I pinged Chris Stone and he offered these thoughts&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,43181/&#34;&gt;Chris&lt;/a&gt; Says:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as I know the instructors at UCF will not be EA employees. As for skills required to intern at EA , these would in clued a strong foundation in animation, basic knowledge of all the principles of Animation, and a good looking Demo reel showing a diversity of work from looping animations (game asset type) to animations that show a lot of character, and personality. With interns we are not looking for tons of Polish but there work should be relatively solid. In addition, an intern&amp;rsquo;s attitude is a huge part of it. A desire to work very hard and literally DO ANYTHING requested of them, as well as an overall excitement about the product goes a long way. With regards to a drawing portfolio in addition to an animation reel, it is not necessary. As with anything art related, a strong foundation of traditional skills is always a bonus and is looked on fondly, however if the choice needs to be made on what to focus on it should ALWAYS be your animation skills. A Solid animator with no traditional portfolio will, always get hired for an animation position before someone with just a decent animation reel even if their traditional portfolio is amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Removed the link to Albert&amp;rsquo;s email. Added a link for Chris.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Merenia Writes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hello, My name is Merenia, I am 13 years old. I go to high school in New Zealand. I know I am to young to get a job as big as this, but I thought I would email you to ask a few things.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I am an animal, art and computer lover. I love stragic games, like The Sims and Zoo tycoon. I own about 4 of The Sims and I hope to buy others. I am excited to hear Sims 2 coming. I am more into computers then the t.v and my dream job that I want when I grow up is to do computer graphics or be game creater,something cool like that. ;D I was just wondering if you could send me some information about Ea games and job opportunities that may come up in the future. Its taken me a while to find your email to email you, and I am happy I have found it. EA games is my favourite brand of games, and I know I can always trust the quality of your work.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Reply:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey Merenia, there are a few websites that you should check out: &lt;a href=&#34;http://web.archive.org/web/20040804061518/http://jobs.ea.com/highschool/index.html&#34;&gt;EA info for high school students&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sloperama.com/advice/designprep.htm&#34;&gt;preparing for a career in games&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://careers.ea.com/&#34;&gt;EA&amp;rsquo;s job site&lt;/a&gt;. Your first step is getting the best college education you can; then you should apply for an EA internship. As we grow EA is recruiting more and more of our talent through our internship program. Your best chance at an internship is if you live in the US, but EA&amp;rsquo;s got offices all over the place and you have &lt;em&gt;plenty&lt;/em&gt; of time to deal with those details later. For now focus on getting a solid college education in something you really love to do and check out those web sites. | And I&amp;rsquo;m really looking forward to the Sims 2 too. The Urbz looks pretty cool as well. :)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to take down the forums. It seemed that most people prefer to email me their questions directly, so I&amp;rsquo;m going to answer the choice ones in the blog. Besides, there are a ton of forums like those at the IGDA and elsewhere that are more trafficked and probably better suited to ongoing conversations on the topic of getting into the industry because they have a lot more participants. I&amp;rsquo;m taking a bunch of the posts and reformatting them as posts so we get the added benefit of having all the content searchable through a single click. I&amp;rsquo;ve also updated the FAQ and I&amp;rsquo;m going through and cleaning up the cobwebs around the rest of the site.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yeay!! Last week I accepted an offer for a permanent job with EA and my first day was this Monday. I couldnt be happierI&amp;rsquo;m working on possibly the biggest game EA&amp;rsquo;s ever done, my boss is one of the most experienced producers in the industry, my whole team is similarly badass, and I&amp;rsquo;m having a ton of fun. Besides the utter luck of landing a job with this team, it feels really good to have worked hard over the past 12 months towards a goal and to have reached it! Now the thank you notes, beers, phone calls, and dinner shall commence. And heres one of the first: thank you-all for taking an interest, writing emails of encouragement, offering advice, and being the best web community a guy could ask for. I&amp;rsquo;ll do my best to return the favor by sharing my experiences and offering what I learn as I go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t ya just hate the whole salary negotiation thing!? Lets say there was a &amp;lsquo;manager&amp;rsquo; position being filled by someone with eight years experience in the industry. What kind of salary would be reasonable with which to begin negotiations? I know theres a lot of considerations and probably a huge range; I&amp;rsquo;m just looking for a baseline to get me headed in the right direction.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Reply:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should talk to recruiters working in the game industry. Since most game recruiters either work, have worked, or compete with EA for talent they would need to keep up-to-date on that sort of information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hi. My name is Ken. I&amp;rsquo;ve read about the mission of EA Trax and how it relates to the music business. I think the concept is very interesting and it has caught my attention. Can you tell me anything about the Music Dept. at EA? How would I go about applying for a job in the music dept.? I havent seen too many postings on the website.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Persistence and directness go along way at EA. Be clear about what you want and what you can bring to the deal. If you really want to get in you must differentiate yourself from the hundreds of others. I cant tell you how of course. My usual advice is leverage your strengths and be creative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;EA has updated the job board on their website. I&amp;rsquo;ve uploaded my resume but when it shows up in the text box, a lot of my alignment is thrown off. Should I adjust it to fit the text box or leave it as it is in its MS-Word state? Which way will EA see it when I submit my resume?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi Kenbo, it might be easiest if you cut and paste your word document into Notepad and then format in that file. Once you have everything all lined up, you can then cut and paste your resume from the Notepad document without having to worry about formatting issues.&lt;/p&gt;

But enough of that crap. I&amp;rsquo;m going to the last day of E3 next weeklooking forward to seeing the show! The game I&amp;rsquo;m working on isnt making an appearance at this one, but I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to catch an Updated on HL2. I&amp;rsquo;m working on recruiting more people to help answer questions in the forums. Ken Felton jumped in to answer a question about careers in audio. Chris Stones been graciously offering the benefit of his experience in animation. Both these guys of amazingly talentedits really cool to be working with them. Youll see what I&amp;rsquo;m talking about when our game comes out. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I am currently working towards my science degree, my goal is to attain a position in audio engineering or related field- it looks like w/ Steve Schnur is where I would want to go  Ofcourse being the biggest fan [and best player] of Madden is a good reason, but my dream career is to be part of the awesome music and/ or sound effects behind these great games that the world craves!! Can anyone offer any suggestions about how to get into an internship in this area&amp;rsquo; I definetely see the importance of networking in this type of business, and will use that as possible assistance. I have NEVER been so excited about anything in my life, I will take any advice!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internship is the way to go. Contact EA University and be prepared to go wherever an audio intern opening might be. I doubt there is anything left for this summer though. BTW&amp;ndash;Mr. Schnur deals only with music licensing. SFX, dialog, and the implementation of the music are up to the team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Does anyone have any information on IT jobs available in Orlando? I&amp;rsquo;m looking to work in the Orlando area. Is there certain certifications that I should get to be qualified or is the best way to start off, is to start at the bottom and work your way up?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.linkedin.com/pub/robert-moreno/0/334/8b9&#34;&gt;Rob&lt;/a&gt; Replies:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it varies depending on what department of IT you work for. Certifications and experience will definitely not hurt you. I know if you want to get in the NT Team (Windows Administration) you will need to have started your MCSE or expect to obtain it if you do get in the team. For the Network Team I&amp;rsquo;m not to sure but I believe that they prefer to have experienced member. Also I think one of the other big things is your motivation for how bad you want it and when you do get how you perform. For the Desktop Team you don&amp;rsquo;t need to have any certs, but you do need customer service skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are lots of specialties in the IT field so I would suggest pick one or two and try do your best at it. Of course it&amp;rsquo;s always hard to get experience if no one is willing to give you a chance. I guess that&amp;rsquo;s where the motivation comes in. Also, obtaining your certs will give you something to work with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re under 30 &amp;amp; probably not making a six-figure salary at EA, where do you live? Redwood City? I&amp;rsquo;m assuming most rent an apartment but what areas are safe and but have clubs, bars, shops, etc.?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Reply:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m under the impression that the towns near Redwood City are not geared to single people under 30. The rent doesnt seem too bad$1200/mo for a 1 room apt or $700 for a room in a house. If you can afford a commute you might enjoy living in SF for roughly the same price and 30 minutes x2 each day.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biggs Writes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing some research on types of jobs at EA. I came to the conclusion that the type of job I wanted would be in the same Dept as Steve Schnur, He is the head of the music dept. for EA. The only thing is, I dont know what kind of schooling I would have to go to in order to work in his department . Can anybody help?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,7086/&#34;&gt;Ken&lt;/a&gt; Replies:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will tell you what I know about Steve and the current EA music process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve comes from the music business and film business. I know he was the music supervisor on a few films. The big change in our policy is that we have shown that putting the name of the song, artist, and label on the screen while our game is running has great value. Steve leverages that value to the max.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would suspect that a deep music and music licensing background plus being an avid gamer would what Steve would look for if he had a position to fill in the EA music dept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I doubt Steve is editing tracks in PT or SoundForge but knowing the current audio tools is a big plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process of getting music in EA games today has nothing at all to do with how we put music in the games just four years ago. I think we have improved the quality of our music in general. However, I doubt that the young, talented, hungry, just trying to get into game business, composers out there would agree with me. I&amp;rsquo;ve been involved with putting music in EA game for over nine years. We did it in many, many ways. A few were good. Most were not. I can say with confidence that our customers are getting better musical value today.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lindsay Writes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;More questions for Chris! Just wondering which EA studio you work at&amp;ndash;Europe, Maxis, Redwood Shores, Burnaby, Downtown Vancouver, etc. Also, if you dont mind, Id be interested in hearing about how you got into the industry yourself and any advice on the best strategy for getting into EA (networking and connections? internships? sending in countless demos?).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,43181/&#34;&gt;Chris&lt;/a&gt; Writes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In regards to Lindsay&amp;rsquo;s question, I work at the Redwood Shores office here in Redwood City CA. just south of San Francisco. I got into the industry more or less on pure luck. When I graduated from college, I turned down many jobs out here in the film industry at various companies in order to stay with my then Fianc in Fla. Because of this I took a job working in Broadcast design doing animation for TV commercials and News promos and various other TREMENDOUSLY boring thingsI hated it. This was around the beginning of PS1 and I was lucky enough to come across a start up company in Orlando doing games 1st party for sony. I worked on some real crap games there, but luckily enough got a break working on Duke Nukem for 3d realms and Gt interactive. After that the door opened wide for me, and I was recruited to move and work out here for Eidos interactive where I stayed for 4 yearsnot a bad place to work. But things got boring for me there so here I came to EAand I love it here, there is nothing like knowing whatever game you work on will sell at least a million units. AS for a strategy for getting in here, well that is a tough one. EA really doesnt tend to hire a lot of new talent they really like people who have a lot or at least some experience in the industry, and more importantly people who look as though they can grow professionally. Internships are great if you are starting out, but they are not easy to get. Put together your best work and submit it, then cross your fingers. If you do get in, work your ass off, learn all you can, and chances are you stand a good chance of getting a job here. Sending countless demos is not the way to go. In general the same people view the demos all the time so you arent tricking anyone. Anyways I hope this answers your questions and feel free to post as many as you want, I will reply as often as I can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good luck to all of you, and who knows, maybe one day I will bump into you here at EAor maybe even interview you!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thomas Writes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chris: Can you describe different roles or capacities that an animator might perform in the game industry? Though my primary interest is in becoming a game designer; I am also interested in cinematic cut scene direction (I did my under grad. in film).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Can one move into game design from animation or is level design a more direct route? Would you mind describing some highlights of your career as an animator? I am currently in the MFA program at the Academy of Art College in San Francisco.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chris Writes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry folks for being AWOL for awhile I have been pretty busy. Anyhoo As for Thomas&amp;rsquo;s question, an animators duties could entail working on cinematics or characters or in game interaction, whatever the need may be. Usually there will be a group of animators that work primarily on the in game stuff and a group that works on the cinematics or &amp;ldquo;cut scenes&amp;rdquo; however when it comes down to it, we tend to bounce back and forth depending on where the need is. As for making a transition from animation to designwell that is pretty rare. EA likes for people to really focus on one area of development. This way you can really grow in your individual roles both professionally and in ability. Design and animation are pretty much polar opposites In my career I have had a lot of moments that really stood out as amazing to me. Most recently while working On Return of the King, I was fortunate enough to get to work with all the stunt doubles from the film. I choreographed and directed all the moves for them to perform for us to capture for the game. The guys and girls were great, and truly amazing at their job. Particularly &amp;ldquo;Brett&amp;rdquo; who was Gimli&amp;rsquo;s stunt doublethere is nothing like watching a 4 foot tall man made of pure muscle wield a double headed ax around the way he does.it&amp;rsquo;s like watching the film live! Amazing&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I spent Wednesday at the GDC and I have to say it was excellent. I served on a panel discussing Quality of Life and a roundtable on the same subject. Unfortunately I did a crappy job of presenting on the panelword to the wise: public speaking is a real skill that needs to be maintained and practiced (and a good presentation requires good prep). The roundtable went well though and we talked about some really good stuff. I was a fan of the idea of having an IGDA Top 50 Studios To Work For each year, sorta like Forbes does for all industries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a lot of talk about unionization, which was a little startling to me. I&amp;rsquo;m not a real fan of unions but a lot of people seem to feel that we either do something to patch up the QoL issues or we are going to be faced with that debate in the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neil Youngs talk about how to organize ones efforts in game design and pacing was really good as was Dave Perry&amp;rsquo;s talk on how to be a good producer. I would have loved to go to more, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to neglect my duties at work. I really think EA should send more people to the GDC, but the powers that be decided to only send a handful this year and I went on my own pass. It seems like such an awesome learning and relationship building opportunity to me&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What would you say would be a better route if I want to get into a production role? I could take a computer game design/programming class that will mostly focus on the implementation process or take classes that revolve around operations management and business classes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Reply:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From what I&amp;rsquo;ve seen all of those skills are useful to a producer, though I think you would have easier time getting a job in todays industry with programming training than with business training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Producers have to form a clear vision of the excellent, profitable game they want to build and then they have to have the leadership and technical skills to coach a diverse team of people (including their supervisors) to build the game and make the needed tradeoffs and improvements along the way. I have yet to meet two producers with the same backgrounds&amp;hellip;there are a lot of paths to becoming a producer, though its not a fit for the interests and abilities of everyone. But that is a different discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hey Scott, You may have no way of gaining this info, but how effective has the web been for recruiting candidates at EA? Do you know of many people who have posted for positions via the web and have had success (success meaning interviews&amp;quot;)? Would it be better to go snail mail? Just curious as to your thoughts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Reply:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the people I talk to got in through a friend, not through a web site. Same with meI got in through networking. If you apply via mail or web you are competing with thousands of other applicants. If your friend introduces you to the person hiring your competing against just a few.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Writers At EA</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;First off, excellent site. I commend you on your creativity and tenacity in achieving your goal. Great job. | I&amp;rsquo;m a screenwriter thats had moderate Hollywood success. Moderate being defined in that I&amp;rsquo;ve sold two scripts to Hollywood production companies but nothing made (yet). I also have a background in I.T. (all areas of project life cycle). | My question is, do you know if EA employs a staff of writers? (For clarification, I&amp;rsquo;m not talking about the copywriters or those who write manuals, but those writers who deal in storyline, dialogue, and character development). I hear developers are bringing in screenwriters and was curious if EA is one of them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Reply:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked around EA and heard: &amp;ldquo;Yes, there are a couple of people here who are capable, and some even accomplished, writers who are also capable game designers. As a writer only, we usually work with them on a contract basis versus an employee because you don&amp;rsquo;t really want a generalist but the best guy at a particular style of writing or story-telling that you want to enhance you game experience.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What type of classes would you recomend me to take if I&amp;rsquo;m interested in being any type of producer or tester? if there is anyone out there that is currently in production at EA or elsewhere could you please share what classes really helped you or any other advice.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Reply:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to be a tester you should own every game system you can get your hands on and play games constantly. Testers are often picked (to the best of my knowledge) for there ability and familiarity with games.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Finding Internship Positions</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I am wondering if anyone can offer any insight into more about the production internships they offer over at EA. I really only see the Tiger Woods Golf one, which is about as good as it gets, but do they offer anymore? Is this a one intern deal? Any help would be greatly appreciated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Reply:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The internship position I have now did not even exist before I landed itI had the good fortune of meeting the right people who offered to get me in. Keep in mind that there are lots of positions that never get advertised (my guess is less than 20% of positions in the industry are ever made public before they are filled) and some positions that are specifically created for people that have made the right friends and the right impression. You greatly limit your opportunities if you are only going for the positions that are visible through advertisements and web pages a.k.a. non-networking channels. | I&amp;rsquo;ve heard somewhere that 80% of job holders in the US got their job through a connection rather than an advertisement. The game industry places even more of an emphasis on personal connection with people they hireso that number is probably even higher. | That said, so far the only other ones I&amp;rsquo;ve seen advertised at EA have been for unannounced products with EA Partners (they handle projects that are developed by non-EA studios and they are growing fast). As far as I know, production internships are far fewer in number than those for engineering, art, and marketing. One might expect as much, considering there are often 20+ artists/engineers/marketers per production person on a team.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>QA Interview Post-mortem</title>
      <link>https://ggr.com/qa-interview-post-mortem.html</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 11 Mar 2004 10:26:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ggr.com/qa-interview-post-mortem.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Reader Writes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s another rejection QA story to read. I was reading over what Jonathan said about his experience before my interview. I had the same test he did ( I know this because the questions he posted were on my test as well). Heres my idea of what there hiring strategy is for new QA testers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They have about 3 or so hiring periods 1 day a week (1:00, 3:00, 5:00 etc..) They pick the best scores out of each group (even if you pass) they will pick the best 3-5 people out of 20 (or how many people are there) in each group. The test I took was kinda easy. Some of the questions I know I missed, but most I&amp;rsquo;m confident were correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Examples of the questions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whats wrong with this picture? (2 pictures are shown of exactly the same thing. It will say, find 4 things that dont match in each one&amp;quot;. Its exactly what you used to do when you were a kid on the back of those Highlights magazines when you were in the waiting room to see the doctor.I still do them now )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spelling (pretty obvious, what word(s) are spelt incorrectly etc..)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*ports Questions (what was the Winston Cup name changed to? Nextel. And I got the dreadlocks question correct thanks for Jonathan and the research I did before the test Ricky Williams)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When your time is up for test 1, they take you into, what I would call, The Game Cube Room and another test ensues. On this one they give you a bug with steps on how to create it, only there are to many steps given. You are to cross off the steps that arent needed etc Next they give you a bug with about 10 steps that arent in order. Your task is to rearrange them in chronological order. This seems easy, but for me it was the hardest part of the test. With the 20 minute time waining you have about 10 minutes left for this part. I felt rushed and I know I just wrote down steps without giving much thought. After that torture, you are to write down at least 2 bugs you find on your own (I found 1). By that time you are free to play and do whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then they call you out 1 by 1. From reading Jonathans post I was ready. If my name was called it means I dont get hired. Well sure enough they called my name . The whole experience reminded me of that scene in Men In Black where they have all the applicants sitting around a table looking serious and dressed well, but what they really want is something different. Only they didnt erase my memory when I left .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What it comes down to is not your application, but the tests they give. They might as well have you fill out your application when youre done with the tests. I guess I&amp;rsquo;m disappointed, but I never really got into sports games that much to begin with and I know I would have gone crazy trying to find bugs in games I didnt really enjoy. But it would have been a good experience none the less. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll apply again sometime. Hope this helps people out.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Full Sail and Classes For Animators</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kim Writes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I am interested in the computer animation, game design field. My question is what is the best classes to take and what will I need to become a great future EA Games associate? What classes should I look for to make sure I am getting my monies worth?I am looking at the computer animation program and Full Sail in Orlando. But the tuition is $58,000. Is a full program like that recommended or could classes be taken at a community college or university individually? I am really interested in the artside of gaming, like character modeling. Also what is the average starting salary range of a EA Games associate with a bachelors degree. I&amp;rsquo;m sure some of these have probably already been asked sorry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,43181/&#34;&gt;Chris&lt;/a&gt; Replies:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey guys and Gals, your board Admin Scott asked me if I could suggest any help to you Animators of the future. Just to give you all a tad of info on me, My Name is Chris, I am an Animation Director here at EA I have been working as an animator in the industry for 9 years now and am currently working on my 13th project. I have to say I have a very mixed opinion on how to obtain a good job in animation. I really think it is more about the particular person than it is about the school you attend. Dont get me wrong though, I think a STRONG understanding of ALL the principles of animation and timing are crucial. These are things I feel are not always delved deeply enough into at these &amp;ldquo;quickstop&amp;rdquo; schools such as Full Sail in Orlando, or Expressions out here in the bay Area. (owned by the same group) However I think the right student with VERY strong motivation can make a good education out of pretty much everything, but expect to push yourself and not necessarily be pushed by your instructors. I general I would say depending on which School you attend you would be better off going to a full Bachelor program. Ringling School of Art and Design, Vancouver film school, Cal arts, all have GREAT programs. I would recommend going to each schools respective web page and look at some example so of work coming out of there, and compare it to work coming out of the 12 month or 18 month programs. The difference is easy to see. As for cost, any good art school will not be cheap. Full Sail and Expressions both floating around 40 to 50 k for 12 to 18 months. Ringling for instance will run you around 20k a year for 4 years, however your education will be MUCH more comprehensive. Anyways I can honestly say that nowadays it is hard to get a good job in animation, without a good education, but no matter where you go and what you spend keep in mind you only get out of it what you put into it, and as for cost.well lets just say a good job will easily let you pay off your student loans. Oh yeah, by the way, those of you considering Full Sail in Fla, might as well make the 3.5 hour drive south to check out Ringling Schools facilities. They are located in Sarasota Fla. and I think the difference in dedication and quality bestowed upon their students will be easy to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated on October 11th, 2013&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Should a college student who wants to get in to the production side of video games look to take a major in say buisiness management or related buisness majors or somthing closer to computers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Reply:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theres no major that maps well to production. Producers vary widely in their areas of expertise from: former artists to programmers to testers to business people. My boss is a senior producer who used to be in marketing. My executive producer used to manage a business software product line. Another producer I&amp;rsquo;ve met has an MBA from Harvard. Neil Young shared some tips with me on what makes a good producer &lt;a href=&#34;https://ggr.com/sit-down-with-neil-young.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Programming vs Marketing</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ian Writes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hi my name is Ian and I am a computer science major at Dakota State University. Where I am at right now is that I&amp;rsquo;m finding out that I am less interested in heavy programming and all the technical aspects of making games and more in to the production/testing/and possibly marketing part of it although the last one is a little iffy. I&amp;rsquo;ve started applying for multiple internships for this summer. Should I continue to major in computer science and go thru the brutal math courses or should i switch to another major that deals with the mentioned above? if so what major would that more then likely be? i would appreciate any help.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Reply:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most anyone is going to perform better when they are working on something they are passionate about. That said, it&amp;rsquo;s much easier to get a job as an engineer in this industry than it is to get a job as a producer. There are fewer production and more people competing for the few positions in production than there are in engineering. I suggest that you stick with your major for now, but try taking some classes in industrial engineering, business, and software engineering (that is to say, something that emphasizes the process of making software rather than the coding itself). Maybe throw a class in political science, rhetoric, and philosophy in there. See what you like then evaluate what you want to do next.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Internship Application Process</title>
      <link>https://ggr.com/internship-application-process.html</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thomas Writes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dear Scott and IWTWAEA posters,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thank you for this resource. It is inspiring to read about your efforts. I&amp;rsquo;ve been putting my portfolio together for various EA Academy internships at the Redwood City campus. I was wondering if I could get some advice on my application process.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I would like to direct my mail and cover letter to a person and not To whom it may concern&amp;quot;. Would I be able to get the proper contact name by calling EA&amp;rsquo;s HR dept, or will I not even make it past the receptionist? I suppose that I&amp;rsquo;ll know tomorrow after I try but if I fail, any backup recommendations would be greatly appreciated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are several internship positions that I am interested in and qualified for. I have already applied for several of these using the online recruiter. When I send in my portfolio and other hard materials should I also include printed versions of the various questions that are asked when applying to jobs with EA&amp;rsquo;s online recruiter? Does it look bad if I am applying for several positions? I assume that I should clearly state the codes and titles of the various positions that I am applying for in my cover letter.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*Since I am applying to an internship as a student, should I place my education or my work experience first on my resume? I am personally more impressed with my education but it seems like game companies don&amp;rsquo;t really care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is there any chance that someone will see my application or do I need to have personal contacts to have my application even considered? I know that networking is key; however I&amp;rsquo;ve only been in San Francisco for a short while and haven&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo;?t met anyone at the IGDA who works for EA. My Clothed Figure Drawing teacher has done concept art for the LOTR games on a contract basis but afaik he is not currently employed at EA.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The deadline to apply for summer internships is almost here; in fact, it will be here before the GDC. Do you think that I might still have an opportunity to appeal myself at the GDC?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Reply:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was applying for positions I tried to get an idea from the description who I would be reporting to. For example, when I was applying for a production position at Maxis I figured out from the description that I would be working on the Sim series. I headed over to Mobygames to see which producers were on the Sim series and then I gave them a call saying I was interested in joining their team. I guessed wrong on the specific producer but they forwarded me to the right one. There &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; creative ways to get the info you are looking for. It takes a lot of time, smarts, patience, and networking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. It doesnt hurt you to apply for more than one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emphasize whatever demonstrates the most relevant and valuable skill for the position you are applying for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had no luck going through the front door because I did not fit the cookie cutter profile. You have to realize that the poor HR pros that work at EA are inundated with resumesif you are not an ideal and exemplary fit for the position they are looking to fill, you arent going to be considered. The HR people are nice people and they want to help, but they plain dont have time to give everyone individual attention. You have to find a way to stand out and if you&amp;rsquo;re like me you have to not only stand out, but you have to overcome a handicap. The best and easiest way (though it is not easy) is to network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your friends dont have any leads to get you started, you need to look elsewhere, but there are tons and tons of ways to network. If you feel like you are getting stuck pick up a book on the topic, join a networking club, or ask a really well networked friend of yours for advice. Its not rocket science but if you arent used to thinking a certain way, it can be hard to see how to do it. Keep at it, youll figure it out! 5) Yes. There are internships at EA year-round, though there are more during certain times of the year. What you really need is to get someone to want to hire you. And that is all about networking.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Business Skills In the Game Industry</title>
      <link>https://ggr.com/business-skills-in-the-game-industry.html</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will Writes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Good evening. I currently work as a Senior Process Manager for a top 10 financial institution. In my current role, I am responsible for ensuring that our institution (over 80 million accounts) complies with multiple forms of USA Patriot Act legislation, including Office of Foreign Assets requirements and Bank Secrecy Act requirements. I manage a direct team of four Process Managers and an indirect team of over 20 Operations/Process Managers across our company, including across 6 different geographic locations and multiple business types. This is all well and good, but I am extremely bored of my job. My true passion is playing video games, which I have done since I was old enough to hold a joystick or to stick a cassette tape in a Commodore 64 and type &amp;ldquo;Load, 8, 1&amp;rdquo;. I&amp;rsquo;ve always felt that the ideal role in life would be one in which you do what you love and you love what you do. I am not in that role today. While my gaming experience goes only as deep as to have played them for countless years, I do have a number of skills that I believe are applicable to just about any business environment. I am trained and certified as a Green Belt in Six Sigma, which is a process management methodology, possess an associate&amp;rsquo;s degree in Project Management, and bring a wide array of functional skills to the table, including multi-tasking, people management, requirements definition, process analysis, leadership and a strong knowledge of regulations and legal affairs. I am not sure what the right positon would be for someone like me at a gaming company, but I do know that I would be happy with just about any position that let me help an industry I enjoyed rather than one that simply paid the bills. Any ideas on where I should start and whether or not I might find a home at EA Games with a skills et as described above?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Reply:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suggest you start looking on the business side of EA. I dont know what the numbers are, but EA probably employs more than half its people in areas other than game production. IT, marketing, publishing, licensing, and all other manner of job skills have a home here. The key is getting in in any role you can&amp;ndash;from the inside youll learn about the different possibilities that interest you and what paths are best to take to become involved with the work you most enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hey Scott, This may be too personal but I thought Id try asking you anyhow since you&amp;rsquo;re the only person I know who might share the answer. Please feel free to disregard&amp;hellip; What is the basic pay rate for EA interns? What other benefits are interns offered that are comparable to benefits accorded to a permanent position? ie. housing, insurance, holidays off or sick days&amp;hellip; If my hubby-to-be gets an internship position -crosses fingers- what would the intern-role be like for married father of an infant? Just curious and want to make plans for additional income if necessary&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Reply:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not certain that my situation is typical since I was shoehorned into the internship program by someone who wanted to help give me a chance. My guess is that most interns make $15-$30k annualized, no benefits (no sick days, no health insurance&amp;ndash;the standard temp full-time treatment). The internship program is really geared towards unattached, younger, less experienced people (like the kind that typically are just graduating). For my own part, I&amp;rsquo;m subsidizing my internship from my savings. I see it as an investment (as does EA, I think) and I&amp;rsquo;ve budgeted accordingly&amp;ndash;I have my own health insurance, dental, etc. I think it would be tough to support a family while starting from scratch in this industry!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>L33t Programmer Wants In</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marquin Writes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alright, so, I&amp;rsquo;ll start off with a simple question&amp;ndash;how does one go about getting a job as a software engineer at EA? I hate to come off as arrogant, however, I have learned that this may be the only chance I have&amp;ndash;every person trying to get a job &amp;ldquo;fluffs up&amp;rdquo; their resume, advertising skills they dont really have. Thus, on a resume, I am the same as anyone else, because even though I may be honest about my skills, I look no different on a resume than someone whos fluffed theirs up. I know that EA must get thousands of job applications and resumes on a weekly basis. My question is: how does one get noticed? I think that there are 2 kinds of programmers&amp;ndash;those that do it for the money, and those that were born with the skill. I am the latter. Even when entering college, I already had more programming and software engineering skills than most PROFESSORS (I wont even compare with the students). Again I&amp;rsquo;m sorry to be so arrogant, but I feel it is the only way to set myself apart. So, even though I may be a more talented and skilled software engineer than most 10-20 year veterans, I am immediately labeled as the &amp;ldquo;college newbie&amp;rdquo; who has &amp;ldquo;no software engineering skills&amp;rdquo; and couldnt write robust code if my life depended on it. In fact, I dont blame them for thinking this&amp;ndash;when I see the other students in my class, even those who love to program, I would also put most of them in that category. My question is&amp;ndash;HOW DOES ONE STAND OUT? How can I show EA that I have what it takes, that I can work with their best. If I had to, I would work for them for FREE for a MONTH just to be able to show them this: whatever it takes. I know that having the right networks count, and that I would have no problem getting a job there if my sisters boyfriends dads cousins boyfriend was a senior software engineer. But I truly believe that if only I could show them my skills, show them that I can solve anything they dish out at me with style and robustness, that they would give me a chance&amp;ndash;if only. Any help anyone could give me would be truly appreciated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Reply:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to stand out is to be a good networker. But&amp;hellip;I&amp;rsquo;ve beat that drum enough&amp;ndash;I&amp;rsquo;ll let you search these forums for ideas on how to do that. Besides that you should write a game. Either write one on your own, or if you aren&amp;rsquo;t interest in game design you should partner with a group writing a MOD or someone else who can provide the design and art side of things. Having a really good demo is going to be a great tool for you to make a good impression when you finally land some face time with the right people. Few things say &amp;ldquo;I will make a good games programmer&amp;rdquo; than &amp;ldquo;I have written 3 games that use the technology you work with.&amp;rdquo; Finally, theres nothing wrong with being confident, but arrogance will get the door shut in your face in this industry. People here are badass but they also place a high value on modesty. If you are a badass you need to show it by what you accomplish (i.e. writing a game).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Transfering To Executive Producer</title>
      <link>https://ggr.com/transfering-to-executive-producer.html</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chris Writes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I have about three years experience in creating stochastic simulations and visualization systems for the US Army at WSMR. In addition I am currently the Executive Producer of a CG kids show for APTN. I&amp;rsquo;m interested in flying the coop here sometime in the next couple of years. What kind of chance do I have to get into an Executive Producer slot at EA. A great deal of my experience is in getting a team of modelers/animators/programmers to create specific simulation systems for the military. In other words, I build very expensive/limited market video games. Does this kind of experience translate into something EA would be interested in?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Reply:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your experience sounds like it would put you in a good position to tackle the sorts of issues that we have in game production. But, my limited exposure to EPs at EA leads me to think that jumping straight into an EP position would be hard to do for a few reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There arent that many EPs in the company. My guess is that there are 5 on the studio side and another 20 in partners and subsidiaries. And at any given time, EA is probably not actively looking for more than a single EP&amp;hellip;if we are looking at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are people both within and outside of EA with 10 years of &lt;em&gt;game&lt;/em&gt; production experience that would love to be an EP at EA. You are competing with them for these rare positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Games cost $10m+ and are typically shipped in 18 months. You would need to have experience with projects of comparable scale (roughly $750k/mo).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people with experience in other industries take a step down when they come to EA. For better or for worse, the game industry generally expects people to prove themselves &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; they are given serious responsibility. EA is like that too. Before I got here I thought that this was a little odd (most of corporate America promotes you into the role first and then you grow into it), but having been at EA a month the value of this conservative approach is very clear&amp;ndash;a lot depends on your chemistry with the people on your team as well as your knowledge of how games are made. Even if you have skills that enable you to ramp quickly, there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; still ramp time for someone coming from another industry. I must offer the disclaimer that my experience is pretty limited&amp;hellip;you should talk to some EPs if you want a more reliable opinion. But for what its worth, thats my 2 cents. If you aren&amp;rsquo;t married to starting at the top I think you would find some cool opportunities an EA that your skills would help you adapt to, but you will have to fight for it. EA&amp;rsquo;s not looking for people that kinda want to be here&amp;hellip;weve got our pick of talented, experienced, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; passionate people that &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; want to work at EA. Thats what youve got to compete with!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Animator Networking</title>
      <link>https://ggr.com/animator-networking.html</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lindsay Writes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hi Scott, I came across your site while looking at the EA Academy site (actually I was examining the guidelines for loopholes to get in as an intern). I gotta say that it was pretty smart of you to start this site&amp;ndash;talk about a great way to get noticed by the company! Anyways, I recently graduated from Vancouver Film School as an animator. I would love to get a job at EA in animation (whether it be as a mocap operator or clean up artist, etc) but am finding it incredibly difficult. As they say, one of the best ways to get your foot in the door is as an intern, however my school does not qualify for the Coop programs at EA Canada (since it is a private school) and you need to be an American to get into the USA EA Academy. So far, I&amp;rsquo;ve just been trying to submit my demo tape in hopes of landing some sort of interview (I&amp;rsquo;m going again tomorrow!) and even though I do know at least two people who work for EA BlackBox and EA Canada, so far, it hasnt seemed to help much. Anyways, I was just wondering if you had any insight as to breaking into EA as an animator. I noticed your great advice on emailing people with credits on your favorite EA games. Also, do you think it is worth a shot sending my demo to EA Redwood, or EALA even though I am a Canadian citizen (getting a visa to work in the USA is incredibly difficult unless you are some sort of genius!)? Thanks and sorry for this rambling post!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Reply:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lindsay, Unless you are an animating genius and it clearly shows in your demo, I suggest you go through the side door rather than the front. You &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; need to have a solid resume and demo, but having them wont really open doors as much as not having them will close them. I have a feeling building relationships with 10 lead animators at EA and other companies will teach you more and expose you to more opportunities than sending your demo out to 1,000 different companies would. Not that that will be easy, but just like working hard is a more reliable way to earn money than buying lottery tickets, I think youll find networking is something you can build on over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way I have been able to meet new people has been through volunteering for the IGDA and contributing time on a whitepaper. I got the chance to help out, learn a ton, and leverage a great excuse to call just about anyone in the industry up for a research/informational interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theres really no secret to how to get into the game business. You need skills and you need to know the right people. If you have the skills work on the people!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S. It cant hurt to send you resume and demo to place in the US&amp;hellip;it just may not prove to be the most effective use of your time. If you have enough time to network and send out your demo everywhere, by all means go for it. But if you had to choose, spending more time on networking is probably the better bet&amp;ndash;and a lot more fun to boot.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What I Do These Days</title>
      <link>https://ggr.com/what-i-do-these-days.html</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 14 Feb 2004 23:35:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ggr.com/what-i-do-these-days.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I made it past my 1 month anniversary at EA and I thought it would be good to reflect a bit on what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned and what I&amp;rsquo;m up to. I continue to be wowed by the people I work with. I&amp;rsquo;m surrounded by the best of the best and it&amp;rsquo;s at once exhilarating and humbling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a Production Intern on an unannounced title which is in the middle of pre-production (the design/early prototyping phase for those of us coming from biz software). I&amp;rsquo;ve been working roughly 10-12 hours a day, 5 days a week&amp;hellip;plus a good amount of time I spend working and thinking on stuff on the drive, on the weekends, etc. At this early stage in the project its not really necessary or expected that I keep these sort of hours&amp;hellip;often Mike Olsen (Lead Designer) and I are among the very few to be found on our floor after 8p. But I&amp;rsquo;m having fun and I want to do a good job, so I figure its the least I can do to show my commitment to doing the best job I can do&amp;ndash;and when it comes to production, design, and project management there is always more to be done. One Friday at 8p as my boss left, he told me to go home as and go bug whatever girl I&amp;rsquo;ve got waiting for me. I smiled and thought to myself: I&amp;rsquo;m &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/1999/01/20&#34;&gt;dating my job&lt;/a&gt; until I&amp;rsquo;ve got a game under my belt&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m applying all these hours at work to several things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Project Management&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I help project manage a handful of work groups. We have a number of groups setup to R&amp;amp;D areas of the games design (like player mechanics and AI). These groups gather people from each discipline (engineering, art, production) to work through unknowns in the design and offer solutions that inform how we go about making the game. Games have an enormous number of systems competing for limited hardware and production resources&amp;ndash;the work groups investigate how to create a game that offers the innovations we want while balancing our constraints. My role is to encourage and direct conversation within these groups towards a set of issues that need resolution. Additionally I work with Lisa Clark (Project Manager) to make certain that bottlenecks and cross-work group issues are highlighted and communicated between the affected groups so that they are addressed dealt with in their proper turn. Sexy, huh? ;) Bottom line is that we are running an R&amp;amp;D organization and effective communication and a common understanding of what we need to get done is critical to doing a good job and getting the job done on time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*&lt;strong&gt;Intranet/IT Dude&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have excellent IT resources for desktop and corporate infrastructure at EA, but team communication tools like an Intranet are more the domain of individual teams and how they prefer to work. I&amp;rsquo;ve put together our intranet, complete with document management and discussion functions, in order to make collaboration that much easier. And since I&amp;rsquo;ve got a bit of an IT background, I&amp;rsquo;ve been pitching in here and there with some of our other IT stuff. This is a chance for me to show of some of my talents and value to the team and buy myself the opportunity to learn about areas of production that I dont provide as much value in yet. And its pretty fun to see people getting some good use out of it&amp;ndash;having the right tools can make a big difference and I think as the team grows the Intranets usefulness will grow as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*&lt;strong&gt;Visual 40k&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first two areas of responsibility offer me tons of exposure to all the intricacies that go into making a game. But the Visual 40k is a bit more producerish and is that much dearer to my heart. The idea is to produce a visual representation of the entire game we are making at the 40,000 foot level of detail&amp;ndash;just enough to help us walk someone through all the features and the first level of underlying systems. I&amp;rsquo;m just starting to work on this and it looks like its going to be a lot of fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*&lt;strong&gt;Design Doc Management&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to make a game of the scale that we are planning we need solid design docs. These docs serve as the foundation for discussing our common vision for the game with the entire team. They are laborious to write, but they come in real handy&amp;hellip;just the other day Mike was explaining a feature to David DeMartini (Executive Producer) and he was skeptical we could pull it off&amp;ndash;until Mike whipped out the design doc showing that we had thought it through. It was a cool demonstration of the value of our design docs. I&amp;rsquo;ve observed that ideas that start in our head go through some serious rework in between being thought up, discussed, and then written down. The docs are like our first prototype. And as with any game, we have tons and tons of ideas, systems, assets, and issues to think through, design, prototype, and write down. Just writing a comprehensive list of everything that needs to be documented, organizing them, prioritizing them, and deciding what kind and level of detail for each topic can be a daunting task. And it&amp;rsquo;s mine. :) This is another item I&amp;rsquo;ve just started to plow into and it&amp;rsquo;s pretty cool. Part project management, part design, part production, by organizing and researching the list of docs I will learn a ton about how the game and our schedule will come together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of all that, I&amp;rsquo;m starting to come out of cave mode so that I can resume my social ways and meet a number of people I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to meet at EA. Besides that, I&amp;rsquo;ve got plenty of people to just say hi to and stay in touch with! Heh heh, my life is choices between various fun things to spend time on. :)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Being A Main Character In An MMORPG</title>
      <link>https://ggr.com/being-a-main-character-in-an-mmorpg.html</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 14 Feb 2004 23:03:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ggr.com/being-a-main-character-in-an-mmorpg.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I realize that Lucas does not need my advice, not the least because I have no idea what I&amp;rsquo;m talking about. But that said, I was walking home from the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.playbill.com/news/article/75255-Berkeley-Rep-and-Oregon-Shakes-Premiere-Edgars-Two-Part-Continental-Divide-in-2003&#34;&gt;theatre&lt;/a&gt; the other evening and I got to thinking about MMORPG and what can be done, taking Star Wars Galaxies as an example. You see, it had come up in an EA interview&amp;ndash;a question about why I think some game works or doesnt and then what could have been done differently, so its not purely a random fun exercise. ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the major challenges with MMPORPGs is that you dont tend to start as a main character in the game. Lets face it, if everyone in the Matrix were a Neo, it would get pretty lame pretty fast&amp;ndash;call it main character inflation. On the other hand, starting everyone as a lackey and making them earn their prominence and thereby restricting the important and cool roles to the people that promote the designers plot&amp;ndash;its making work for you players. And they are &lt;em&gt;paying&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;play&lt;/em&gt;. If you are out of high school this starts to seem like a bad idea, I suspect. I recall that when I was high school at least, games that I had to work hard to enjoy seemed a little more appealing than they do today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you start everyone as a Jedi, they will wreck chaos and kill things, and act un Jedi-like. Its too easy and the people who dont give a rats ass about the integrity of the story world would ruin it for everyone. Plus, they can just start over and do it again&amp;ndash;theres no real consequence or indoctrination since they didnt have to work for months on end to earn their position. But lets see, what would you call people that act with reckless abandon and abuse their powers arbitrarily. Id say EVIL. And who is evil, powerful, and takes the easy way to power without earning it in the SW universe? How about the Sith?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I would just start everyone out as Sith and let them wreck havoc if they want. Give people that are good the opportunity to convert to good Jedi or give people that want to be part of a plot the opportunity to build, but let the chaos people have their fun too. You still have to earn your wings, but you dont start as a lackey. I mean hey, if they want to go around killing people all over the place why not accommodate them and create a world that reacts realistically to that sort of abuse?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bottom line is that we need to find a way of making everyone important (i.e. feeling like a main character) from the beginning without screwing up the game world.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Interview With EA Tiberon</title>
      <link>https://ggr.com/interview-with-ea-tiberon.html</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2004 10:22:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ggr.com/interview-with-ea-tiberon.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jonathon writes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got to Tiburon around 3:40pm. My interview wasnt until 4pm, so that was good. I would have been there even earlier, but we had a little trouble finding the place. Good thing we left early!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I walked into Tiburon, very cool building. I saw some arcade machines and stuff in this one room, it must have been the game room. I then found where I needed to go, told them I was there for the interview, and they gave me an application to fill out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I got done filling out about 80% of the application, they called everyone in a room to take a test and said we could finish our applications afterwards. So the 15-20 or so of us walked in to take the test. Some were around my age (19 years old), others were in their mid-20s, and some people looked to be over 30. Most of them looked like hardcore gamers. I look liked a beach lifeguard in comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me give you a sample of some of the questions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a lily pad in a pond. Every day the pad doubles in size. On the 60th day, the pad covers the whole pond. How much of the pond does it cover on the 59th day? (By the way, they worded it a little trickier than I just did).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the names of 5 football players. Which one has dreadlocks?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 10 3 9 5 8 7 7 9 6 ? ?&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
What numbers go in the question marks?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today is Friday. What is the day after yesterday, that follows the day before it, after the day after that, before that day?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they had other logic, sports, and math questions that were easier and harder than my samples above. They also had video game questions and grammar/spelling questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the timed test (30 minutes, seemed like 15 but I finished the test in time) they took us into a room with a bunch of burgundy colored Gamecubes. We each had our own TV and console, and we were playing a test copy of Madden 2004. They gave us 20 minutes, and we had to find and write down as many bugs that we could find. One I found was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;From the Main Menu, go to Madden 101.&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
Then go to Whats New?&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
Then back out of it and the NFL logo will have a graphical glitch.&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also gave us 20 minutes to find the glitches that they had written down for us already, and to cross out the unnecessary steps. That was actually pretty easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So then, after the tests, they said we could just chill and play the games while they grade the tests. A few minutes later I got called outside of the room (and I was winning 7 to 0. Take that, Cardinals!). He walked me outside of the little office and said something like, Well unfortunately this is the walk out of the office which means you arent hired. The way he said it, I thought he was joking with me. But then I realized he was serious. He said that I just didnt score high enough on the written test. I asked him, Do you know how well I scored? Was it like average? and he said, I dont really know. But were hiring the top 5 out of the 20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I must have messed up badly on the math and sports questions. While in the parking lot waiting for my ride home, I figured out the math questions without even trying. The answers just suddenly appeared in my head, my subconscious must have been figuring them out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So all in all, it was a fun experience. I guess I&amp;rsquo;m meant for other work. To be honest, while I was playing the game to find glitches for the 20 minutes, I started to think to myself, I dont know if I want to do this all day. I think itd become more tedious than bagging groceries was. Some of you may think, oh yeah Jonathan, playing video games is so tedious. But it is. Were not just playing games all day. Were going through menus, going back and forth doing the same thing hundreds of times (but just a little different each time) to make sure it works. I could see how it would get old fast, and I understand why many game testers say they rarely ever play video games for fun anymore at home. It all takes a certain type of mentality. I think a true hardcore gamer would love it, but I&amp;rsquo;m not that hardcore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a couple tips for becoming a game tester, based on my little experience:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you know someone in the industry, that can help a lot. I have a friend, who has a sister, who has a friend that works as a programmer in the industry. That friend helped my friends nephew become a game tester without any tests like the ones I did. Was that confusing enough for you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Know the companys games. I havent played a Madden game in years, and I wasnt very knowledgeable about sport players, especially football and Nascar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated on October 10th, 2013&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Removed the link to Jonathon&amp;rsquo;s email, I figure he doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to keep hearing from people through this page nor be exposed to more spam.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What EA Wants In A Tester</title>
      <link>https://ggr.com/what-ea-wants-in-a-tester.html</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2004 11:35:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ggr.com/what-ea-wants-in-a-tester.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jeremy Writes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I have a couple of questions. First I am attending a community college in pennsylvania for a generalized computer degree and I am also planning on getting my mcse certification. What I am wondering is how can I get into the industry now to gain experience, I heard that testing is an excellent way to get started but what kind of experience are they looking for in testers. I love video games and EA is always been a favorite of mine, if you could tell me anything I would appreciate it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Reply:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dont speak from firsthand knowledge here, but I&amp;rsquo;ve been told that companies like EA are looking for a few things in their testers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A high level of familiarity with all of the main platforms: Xbox, PS2, Gamecube, PC, GBA. Its good to be able to say you own all of them and play them regularly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good written communications skills. You are going to need to help engineers track down bugs, so the ability to document the steps needed to reproduce the bugs are essential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really good gaming skills. You are sometimes being asked to push the game and find bugs that most people would not. In order to do that in a timely manner its important that you are able to play through the game more quickly than the average player. Your interviewer may interpret the number of recent games that and the total games you have every played as a good indicator of how hardcore of a gamer you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>How To Start Networking</title>
      <link>https://ggr.com/how-to-start-networking.html</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2004 11:27:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jon Writes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Howdy, I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading everything you have on your site about building contacts and networking but I&amp;rsquo;ve found a snag that I was wondering if you could help me with. Currently I&amp;rsquo;m a student and the University of Texas A&amp;amp;M. I&amp;rsquo;m majoring in Architecture with plans on joining a graduate level program designed to teach 3d modeling, 3d programming, animation, and basically anything related to the special effects field of movies. But I want to get into games.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s my question about your page. Where did you start? The bottom pages of your blogs are you talking to new contacts that you met through other contacts. How did you meet them? I don&amp;rsquo;t know anyone working professionally in the gamming market. I do know several animators that are currently unemployed .wince. be nice if they had a job, would make me feel better about the market. I would like to get into production as well.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I think the graduate program would prepare me very well for trying to tie everyone&amp;rsquo;s work and progress together, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think that alone will land me a job. I&amp;rsquo;m a member of TAGD, or the Texas Aggies Game Developers. But the project they are currently working on isn&amp;rsquo;t in need of artists or any form of supervision. So, um, where did you start? Again, thanks for your time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Reply&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as my networking efforts are concerned, they started with my immediate friends and family. I sent a mass email out to the people I knew regardless of whether I had any reason to suspect they might know someone in the industry. In that email I told them what I was doing and who I wanted to meet (anyone related to the game industry in some way). Then I partied: I spent more and more time socializing and it just so happens that everyone asked about my profession. I told them I was working on learning more about the game industry. These two things got me a lot more leads than I expected&amp;hellip;often from people I never would have guessed. My next lead generation tool was this website and domain, which turned every email I sent (&lt;a href=&#34;mailto:scott@iwanttoworkatea.com&#34;&gt;scott@iwanttoworkatea.com&lt;/a&gt;) into a little advertisement for what I was trying to learn about. The website URL got forwarded because it was &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0385496680/qid=1075846369//ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/002-0621513-6116815?v=glance&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;n=507846&#34;&gt;buzzy&lt;/a&gt;, and it reminded everyone I emailed that I was interested in meeting people in the game industry. My third set of tools were cold-calls and emails which I talk about here (sorry, forum link removed).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tips If You&#39;re In High School</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An Anonymous Reader Writes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ok i have always been interested in games and making them was always my dream job and i was woundering if there are any tips you guys could give me for making it come true i am still in high school and i am trying to figure out what i am going to do with my life and i just bought a new game (need for speed: underground) and in the back it said something about ea academy and it made me want to check it out and i did which is how i got here and figured i would ask some pros about it so here it is above well hope you guys can help.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Reply:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can think of a few things that would help anyone in high school to prepare for a career in the game industry:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get into the best college you can&amp;ndash;the game industry is full of self-made badasses who didnt go to college, but its getting harder and harder to break-in and advance without a well-rounded education. As the games get bigger its more and more important to have people on the team who have been exposed to the industrys best-practices as well as the broad topics that a formal education offers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sign up for an internship with a company like EA and besides that, try to get a summer job testing games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read about the industry, play games with an eye for how they are designed, and generally learn everything you can about games. The &lt;a href=&#34;http://web.archive.org/web/20031203004739/http://www.igda.org/breakingin/&#34;&gt;IGDA&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sloperama.com/advice.html&#34;&gt;Sloperama&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gamasutra.com/&#34;&gt;Gamasutra&lt;/a&gt; are some good places to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Network. Its a tired adage, but its true&amp;ndash;your career will depend more on who you know that what you know. Get in the habit of building relationships with people, staying in touch, and being a connector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Some Networking Ideas</title>
      <link>https://ggr.com/some-networking-ideas.html</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dave Writes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nice forum, Scott. I have actually set up phpBB a few times for friends I host websites for. I am presently in the process of creating a forum interface in Flash. The initial backend is CODE:NEO with MySQL, but I will probably port it to PHP, as well. Have you ever seen a message board done in Flash? I think I might have something original with that. So I want to work at EA! I infer that you already do. I recently moved to the Orlando area, which puts me close to Maitland where the Tiburon division is located, yes? What exactly does it take to get in?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Reply:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting a gig with EA (or any game company for that matter) is all about networking. There is a surplus of talented people interested in working at EA. One of the best ways you can stand out from the crowd is by having relationships with a bunch of people that work there. First you have to meet them and make a favorable impression and then you have to stay fresh in their memory long enough for them to think of you when their team has its next opening for someone of your skill and interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some ideas on how to get started on meeting people at EA:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attend the meetings of your local IGDA chapter and say hi to as many people as you can. Ask them for advice about what career path to take, what they like/dislike about the industry, how they got into the industry, who else you should talk to, etc. DO NOT ask them for a job&amp;hellip;as someone else I met put it quite well, you dont want to put them in a position to say no to you&amp;hellip;you just want to be visible and well thought of. If you do a good job, they will think of you when there is an opening. After all, you are asking for advice about how to break in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make a list of you favorite games of all time. Look up the credits on Mobygames. Try to find emails for all the people on the team and email them telling them how much you loved their game and asking them about what it was like to make it. Mention you are trying to learn how to become a badass producer/programmer/etc. and you are just getting started and trying to learn all you can about the industry and how everything works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talk to everyone in the industry, not just people at EA. Everyone has something interesting and helpful to share with you about their experience and perspective. And the more friends you have in the industry the more people that might introduce you to someone new or a new opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read. The more you know about the industry&amp;ndash;the more sincere enthusiasm you demonstrate to the people you are talking to, the better your chances. My blog is a good place to start&amp;ndash;if you read through the archives youll find that I document a lot of conversations and sources for reading materials that will give you a real leg up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, have fun with the process. It can be easy to get caught up in all the work it takes to break in so make sure your not just meeting people to get a job. Meet people because you want to learn and its really fun to hear about how that cool game was made. If you are diligent in making your journey fun as well as effective, you will go much further. And you will have fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While working to add forums I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to move the site and change Blog engines. This is the new one. I&amp;rsquo;m in the middle of restoring the content and finding my way around, so please pardon the sawdust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated on October 10th, 2013&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I was using Movable Type and changed to Wordpress. Of course these days its Octopress.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Budgetting For a Game Career</title>
      <link>https://ggr.com/budgetting-for-a-game-career.html</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2004 11:05:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ggr.com/budgetting-for-a-game-career.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Being a production intern, it occurs to me that I make less money than I used to. ;) Starting a new career involves making some sacrifices and in my case I knew to expect some belt tightening. Planning for this has been key&amp;ndash;at least for myself, I find that I dont need much money to live on comfortably as long as I pay attention to what I&amp;rsquo;m spending money on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The long-term plan is to learn everything I can and build the value of the contribution I can make to EA. Every day I&amp;rsquo;m learning a ton and everything I learn makes me more effective in my role. I love what I&amp;rsquo;m doing and the people I work with are great&amp;ndash;with a boss like Hunter and the uber-experienced and helpful team I&amp;rsquo;ve lucked out to have, I see it as a matter of time before I learn enough to take things up to the next level of ass-kicking goodness&amp;hellip;which is pretty fun to work towards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Habits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in the short-term I&amp;rsquo;ve found some really interesting things by thoroughly reviewing my budget. I hadnt thought much about just how much I was spending on my car or what eating out everyday has been costing me. Both were less of a big deal on a bigger salary but now they are taking up a noticeable chunk of the budget pie. Then there are my communication bills: land line, cell phone, DSL, and hosting for my various websites. The smaller budget has forced me to do a spring cleaning of my finances and I couldnt be happier about it&amp;ndash;as I work my way up in salary over time I will get to keep the habits I&amp;rsquo;ve formed that are saving me money right now. I&amp;rsquo;ll have more money to put towards savings towards a future house and other things that I would much rather have than extraneous internet accounts and eating out 2 meals a day. Heck&amp;hellip;I enjoy cooking, I just never had as strong an incentive to build it into my routine!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moral Of the Story&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Budgets are good (and MS Money or Quicken help). Its a great feeling to be in control of my finances and to understand how I can be more lean and mean. Yall gotta try it.&lt;/p&gt;

I&amp;rsquo;m working on putting up some forums so more people can check out the questions and discussions that have been happening in email and blog comments up to this point. I bet there are some people who visit this site on occasion who know a lot more than I do about breaking into the industry and might be happy to help out as well!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully I&amp;rsquo;ll have the forums up and running next weekI&amp;rsquo;m waiting on my ISP to respond to my request to set up what I need to get going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m also starting to think about who I want to meet next at EAI&amp;rsquo;ve been busying myself with the work at hand for the past few weeks, but Id like to start branching out again, maybe spend a couple lunches a week meeting new people at EA. Its a whole lot of fun just to sit down with new people and chat about what they do, and I expect it will be that much easier to get in touch with people from an EA email address. :)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>First Week At EA</title>
      <link>https://ggr.com/first-week-at-ea.html</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2004 10:27:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ggr.com/first-week-at-ea.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I started work Tuesday and man, I&amp;rsquo;m having a great time! I really lucked out&amp;ndash;Hunter and Lisa have tons of experience are a real pleasure to work with. Everyone I&amp;rsquo;ve met so far has been helpful and enthusiastic in fact&amp;ndash;like Victor and Robert in IT who have been going out of their way to help me get what I need. I dont know if I&amp;rsquo;ve ever worked with more helpful IT guys. Its pretty cool. But lemme tell you about what I&amp;rsquo;m doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m on the team that is building EA&amp;rsquo;s next big game. Its bigger and more ambitious than anything EA has built before (considering EA, thats saying something). And thats about all I can tell you about it until its officially announced. Its about the sweetest project I could imagine starting my game career with. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first day was spent absorbing info and ideas from Hunter and getting to know some basics about where I&amp;rsquo;m working. Got my computer and cube setup too. Day 2 Hunter filled my plate with stuff to work on. And dont let me leave out Lisa who helps me with just about everything, filling me in on all manner of things related to the stuff I&amp;rsquo;ve been assigned all the way to where the pens are kept. Day 3 I&amp;rsquo;m jamming on my assignments which include the Intranet site and managing a technology migration that is about half finished at the point I come in. Day 4 I&amp;rsquo;m hitting my groove, getting stuff done and having a good time of it. And since I started on Tuesday, thats my first week!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a member of the production team I&amp;rsquo;m working with a lot of people to help make sure everything that need to get done is prioritized and taken care of properly. We are in the early stages of the game so there is a lot of R&amp;amp;D going on and its especially important to keep the communication lines open while balancing the need to not suck everyones time into too many meetings. Its like building a startup that whose purpose is to invent and deliver a bleed-edge consumer product technology in 18 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think if you can produce a game well you have some serious skills&amp;ndash;watching them work I have more and more respect for Hunter and Lisa each day I&amp;rsquo;m there. Lisa manages to keep it all straight in her head and helps keep everyone focused on what they need to do and Hunter does much of the same while also being responsible for building a vision for the project and then selling it to management. Its really something to see these two in action. They probably dont think much of it but as someone new its fun and inspiring to watch two people with their experience and talent at work.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>FAQ</title>
      <link>https://ggr.com/faq.html</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2004 00:01:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ggr.com/faq.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the point of all this?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This site exists to encourage and educate future EA employees about the roles and people of EA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started looking into the game industry I couldnt find much guidance about how to make the jump coming from 10 years in another industry. So, I decided I would share my experiences and try to blaze a path for the next person. Much of the blog was written while I was in the middle of figuring out how to find a job with EA. I have since been hired by EA as a producer on an unannounced action-adventure game so the tactics I have used have at least worked once!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there an IWantToWorkAtLucasArts.com too?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, there are no other sites (by me, at least) like this. But there is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iwanttoworkforgoogle.com/home.html&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m from EA, what is it you are looking for?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shoot me an email to say! Be sure and let me know if you are interested in contributing your insights and stories about the industry&amp;ndash;I&amp;rsquo;m looking for other EA employees who can add another perspective and set of experiences to the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I want to work at EA too! What should I do?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read this blog from the beginning. Really&amp;hellip;it wont hurt too much. I&amp;rsquo;ve done my best to pack it chock full of real conversations, notes, and strategies that I&amp;rsquo;ve used to get a job at EA. Everything from how I met each person to what I was asked in interviews is in there. I&amp;rsquo;ve also included books that I&amp;rsquo;ve read, answers to questions that have been emailed to me, and updates about what I&amp;rsquo;m doing now that I&amp;rsquo;ve landed a job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What will happen to this site once you land a gig at EA?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original plan was to Dread Pirate Roberts this sucker and make the site available to someone else to steer around while &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; search for a gig at EA. I havent thought of a good way to actually do that, so the current plan is to evolve it into a place to answer questions about getting a job at EA, questions about the industry, and posts about the work of a producer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You quoted/misquoted me and I&amp;rsquo;m afraid &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; will come after me!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dont want to misquote you and I absolutely do not want to get you in trouble! Just let me know where the troublesome quote is and I&amp;rsquo;ll fix it or remove it&amp;ndash;whichever is called for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I have an idea for a game&amp;ndash;who can I talk to?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a very popular question and Tom Sloper offers some &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.discovergames.com/how2sell.htm&#34;&gt;excellent advice&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I started our call by updating Lisa on my conversation with Hunter Smith, and she let me know what she had found. Basically, she feels stuff has a good chance of coming together at EARS shortly and shes still waiting to hear back from the other studios. Weve decided we should touch base one more time this year and then follow up after the holidays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated on October 9th, 2013&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Removed the link to my conversation with Hunter, I don&amp;rsquo;t know where that blog post went&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://ggr.com/call-with-david-de-martini.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had the chance to speak to &lt;a href=&#34;https://ggr.com/a-quick-hello-with-david-de-martini.html&#34;&gt;David De Martini&lt;/a&gt; today and tell him my story. He offered to help me land an internship since its the easiest way to get me in the door and give me a chance to prove what I can do. I asked whether I had been out of college too long, but he seemed confident he could hook me up with a position. Sweet. It will give me the chance to learn from the &lt;em&gt;inside&lt;/em&gt; AND it gives me exposure to the people I want to work with. I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to hearing back from him! I&amp;rsquo;m going to follow up in a couple weeks if I dont hear from him sooner. I wasnt clear on whether the internship he had in mind started in January or if it recruited in January to start during the summer. Youll know when I know. ;)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Growing Pains For The Industry</title>
      <link>https://ggr.com/growing-pains-for-the-industry.html</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2003 10:57:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ggr.com/growing-pains-for-the-industry.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been told by a few people that getting into the game industry these days is a bit trickier than it used to be&amp;ndash;now that its grown into something with some amount of status (where it used to be considered more of a hobby than an industry), a lot of people have taken an interest in working in the industry. So, you might expect it would be a buyers market for talent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lots Of Applicants&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it &lt;em&gt;sort of&lt;/em&gt; is&amp;ndash;whenever you apply for a job in the industry, hundreds of other people apply as well. There appears to be a vast wasteland of game companies that flop for various reasons, thereby unleashing a bunch of people with at least some game industry experience. Its a pretty tough business for the small guys and its only getting tougher as the budgets for games keep getting bigger ($10m+ is more and more common). These &lt;a href=&#34;http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/ronin&#34;&gt;ronin&lt;/a&gt; are added to a pool of newbies and working veterans that are also looking. It all adds up to a ton of applicants for the HR departments of these companies to pour over every time they post a job advertisement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet the execs and HR people I&amp;rsquo;ve spoken to have told me about the trouble they are having finding the right talent. EA, for example, is expanding fast, which is a &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; challenge to have. &lt;a href=&#34;https://ggr.com/lunch-with-bing-gordon.html&#34;&gt;Bing Gordon&lt;/a&gt; tells me they need more executive producers, but there arent that many people with the right experience and talent within the industry. &lt;a href=&#34;https://ggr.com/flyby-chat-with-philip-gee.html&#34;&gt;Philip Gee&lt;/a&gt; pointed out that they are having trouble finding qualified engineers as fast as they would like while &lt;a href=&#34;https://ggr.com/on-the-phone-with-craig-alexander.html&#34;&gt;Craig Alexander&lt;/a&gt;s team has been interviewed hundreds of people just to fill a few production positions. There would seem to be no shortage of applicants, but there is a definite shortage of superstar talent that all the employers are competing for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But a Shortage Of Diamonds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, it can&amp;rsquo;t be all that bad at the lower levels, like associate producers, since the salaries and the hours don&amp;rsquo;t seem to be going up all that fast. If EA needed people in these positions that badly they&amp;rsquo;d probably use aggressive compensations plans to make recruiting and retention easier since they, unlike a lot of companys have that competitive option in their tool belt. But the higher up you go in the ranks, the bigger a shortage there is; and it looks like its only going to get worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, the industry is in growth mode and the companies that are driving the growth, like EA, are competing for the badasses. Now, badasses develop through accident and good fortune at some rate X. And the industry is growing at some rate Y. The problem is that Y is much greater than X. The supply of leadership talent is going up much more slowly than demand for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has a couple implications. First, exec producers and the like are going to make more and more money as their demand goes up relative to their supply. Hey, its a tough job&amp;ndash;good for them! Second, companies like EA are going to find their growth continually bottlenecked by their inability to find the quality of leaders that can build the new teams and franchises. Further, as the budgets for these new projects keep getting bigger, the pool of talent that rises to the &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; level of badass-edness is going to shrink, slowing down X even &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some Ideas On What To Do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think there a few challenges and number of possible solutions, here are my ideas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Grow new leaders:&lt;/em&gt; There is a shortage of executive producers (and certain other positions) and it&amp;rsquo;s going to get worse because of a supply that is growing slower than demand &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; because the bar is also being raised, further limiting supply. So, the industry can either live with the bottleneck or they can work to increase the supply of leaders. There are a few ways to do that: a) you can put more resources into building the next generation of leaders from scratch &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4AF3E1CD74276107&#34;&gt;like GE&lt;/a&gt; does, b) you can get better at turning existing talent into the next generation of leaders, and c) you can get better at turning already started leaders from other industries into leaders in the game industry. Few companies within the game industry have the resources to do any of these, and they are going to get their asses kicked by the companies that do (like EA) because the price of talent is going to go up and the only people that can generate and keep the talent are going to be the big guys. Besides that, people like &lt;a href=&#34;https://ggr.com/sit-down-with-neil-young.html&#34;&gt;Neil Young&lt;/a&gt; who take an active interest in grooming the next generation of leaders are going to be the guys running the show because it will be &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; people that are rising in the ranks while the other leaders are too busy with their day-to-day responsibilities to invest in new talent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Build a better filtering system:&lt;/em&gt; In order to get into the industry as a newbie these days you have to be a good marketer, a good networker, and very persistent. If you try to go in the front door (i.e. apply for some job posting online) you can pretty much forget it unless you have a skill that is in low supply. But, as a newbie, that isn&amp;rsquo;t all that likely, though it is possible. If you happen to be some badass programmer or artist or designer in the making but you don&amp;rsquo;t have a penchant for marketing and networking, well, you better have the persistence thing down, it may take a long while. I suspect a lot of talent gets left behind using this system&amp;ndash;it&amp;rsquo;s like mining for diamonds but throwing the rubies and emeralds away when you find them. They aren&amp;rsquo;t diamonds, after all. And heck, the industry needs more veterans, not more newbies, high-potential or not, right? Well, that depends. I may be wrong here, but it seems to me that if you want to groom the next generation of leaders in engineering, where it&amp;rsquo;s less important that they have marketing skills (let&amp;rsquo;s call them rubies), you might be better off keeping the rubies too. Perhaps companies like EA could make themselves a better front door by giving newbies of all sorts a chance to prove themselves. I mean, instead of locking all the doors and telling the to hack or sneak their way in, EA could have a monthly contest where you are asked to create an innovative game design spec using a given template that meets certain requirements. All entrants will be scored and anyone who gets above a certain score is guaranteed face time with HR and the producer sponsoring the contest. Contests could rotate&amp;hellip;level design one month, animation another (i.e. animate a barrel falling off a cliff and exploding at the bottom using &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.nvidia.com/cg-toolkit&#34;&gt;Cg&lt;/a&gt;; everyone who meets the spec gets interviewed). Something like that could create great PR and goodwill for EA and also gain better access to the diamonds, rubies, and emeralds than before. I think a lot of newbies would love to have a challenge where they know what to expect and can match their skills and enthusiasm against a visible target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Find new places to mine:&lt;/em&gt; At the moment the game industry doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem very well equipped to transform talent from other industries into talent within gaming. The company that gets really good at this (like if EA had a formal, robust program for turning biz software producer and film producers into game producers) will have a whole new talent pool to draw from that no one else in the industry will have. Could be quite the competitive advantage. And long term, the game industry might be better served it could leverage people that aren&amp;rsquo;t fanatic gamers and ubertalented people who have dedicated their lives to this cause. I mean, &lt;em&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m&lt;/em&gt; a gaming nut, but I look around at the slightly older industries that make the most money and I see industries that are really good at taking people of average talent and helping them contribute at above average levels. There are only so many people that have both the talent and the willingness to sacrifice their lives to game production in the world and I worry that a company that is entirely reliant on that sort of person has yet another talent bottleneck to deal with. I just look at the number of people that start in the industry at 20 and leave at 30 in order to make more time for their families as a huge challenge&amp;ndash;all that investment and talent is lost to the industry. My guess (which is largely informed by the rough drafts of the QoL &lt;a href=&#34;https://ggr.com/igda-and-the-good-life.html&#34;&gt;whitepaper&lt;/a&gt;, so I can&amp;rsquo;t take much credit) is that the answer lies about 20 years in the future when we&amp;rsquo;ve gotten even more consistent at making great games on-schedule and on-budget. Then we&amp;rsquo;ll be able to offer people better hours and create programs that better leverage non-game-fanatics on more predictable projects. Heh heh. Though there will always be people like me who &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; kicking butt and taking names as work and hobby. ;)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lisa Bell called me this afternoon with a quick &lt;a href=&#34;https://ggr.com/maxis-asst-prod-update-number-2.html&#34;&gt;update&lt;/a&gt;: shes been in touch with her counterpart at EARS: Rachel McIntyre. Rachel was out of town when I &lt;a href=&#34;https://ggr.com/in-person-interviews-with-eap-round-number-1.html&#34;&gt;met with EAP&lt;/a&gt;, otherwise I would probably have met her then, though I keep hearing her name. Anyway, Lisa has also been in touch with a couple of her Canadian counterparts too; but everyone (outside of Maxis at the moment) is hella busy hiring, so she thinks they will take a couple days to get back to her. So Lisa and I have a followup scheduled next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heh heh. I love that Lisa schedules her phone meetings&amp;ndash;I wish more people did that. It makes it so easy to, you know, plan your day. Its a lot tougher when someone just asks me to call sometime next week or says theyll call me within that sort of time range. Phone tag inevitable ensues. Lisa has her shit together and its nice. :)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Shawn Kresal sent me this article about Spike TVs video game awards show. Itll be interesting to see how well games and TV mix&amp;hellip;I suspect it will take some trial-and-error to find a good mix. Few game makers, much like the non-actors in movies, have transformed themselves into TV&amp;ndash;compatible celebrities so far. But hey, perhaps our day is coming!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Post-mortem With EAP</title>
      <link>https://ggr.com/post-mortem-with-eap.html</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 03 Dec 2003 20:57:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ggr.com/post-mortem-with-eap.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A couple days ago I emailed &lt;a href=&#34;https://ggr.com/on-the-phone-with-craig-alexander.html&#34;&gt;Craig Alexander&lt;/a&gt; thanking him for the opportunity to &lt;a href=&#34;https://ggr.com/in-person-interviews-with-eap-round-number-1.html&#34;&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; with his team and asking for a time to talk and get his feedback on the interviews. While I wasnt a fit for somewhat &lt;a href=&#34;https://ggr.com/first-ea-app-complete.html&#34;&gt;structural reasons&lt;/a&gt; I figured there were probably other areas that could use some improvement. We connected this evening and Craig &lt;em&gt;buried&lt;/em&gt; me with help and advice!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started the conversation with a quick recap of what I was looking for: how I could have presented myself better and what I should do to be better prepared when I interview with other groups at EA. Craig told me that everyone liked me and a few people had spoken up saying that EA really needs to hire me&amp;ndash;somehow find me a position. :) In the end, he said, EAP isnt equipped to bring someone new to the industry up to speed in the roles they are hiring for right now. But said hed like to do whatever he can to help me get a position at EA and he was instructing HR to see what they could find in Studio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked him where I should be focused and who I should talk to next and he told it was good that I had spoken to &lt;a href=&#34;https://ggr.com/sit-down-with-neil-young.html&#34;&gt;Chris Plummer&lt;/a&gt; (he and Chris used to sit next to each other at EA) and that &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId=43172/&#34;&gt;Glen Schofield&lt;/a&gt; is good too as Bing had said. He suggested &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,31114/&#34;&gt;Rade Stojsavljevic&lt;/a&gt;&amp;hellip;well, hes moving to Craigs team from EALA shortly but he may be able to offer me some tips. At EARS there is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId=13628/&#34;&gt;David Yee&lt;/a&gt; who produced Earth and Beyond as well as UXO (Ultima Online 2). And theres the COO &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId=21965/&#34;&gt;JF Prata&lt;/a&gt; who is hiring a DD&amp;ndash;that might be a good opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He then pulled up the EA jobs site (and so did I) and went through all the postings. We found a couple positions in Studio, a couple in IT. He suggested I look into all of them as possible feet-in-the-door. Plus, he pointed out, in a position like IT I&amp;rsquo;m likely to make a lot more which is never a bad thing. Craig offered to put me in direct touch with the right people, bypassing the website for any position I find on there that I may be interested in! That would be a &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; help. Personal introductions are key for someone in my position especially. For IT I should get it touch with Greg Bartlett and Mark Fronz&amp;ndash;they are the senior managers there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whew! This is awesome. Plenty of new people to meet&amp;hellip;goes to show, make those follow-up calls! :) It helps if you are lucky enough to meet stand-up, senior management, industry guru, well connected people like Craig of course. Thanks Craig!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Phone Call With Lisa Bell</title>
      <link>https://ggr.com/phone-call-with-lisa-bell.html</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 03 Dec 2003 15:53:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ggr.com/phone-call-with-lisa-bell.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lisa and I &lt;a href=&#34;https://ggr.com/maxis-asst-prod-update-number-2.html&#34;&gt;spoke briefly&lt;/a&gt; a couple months ago, before scheduling todays informational interview. Lisa called right on time. She started by mentioning that this site has been an item over at Maxis and the blog entry that mentioned our first encounter had gotten her some attention. :) I hope it was good! I took the opportunity to let her know that I dont post anything that I suspect or am told is confidential, and I give my conversation partners the final say on material I put on here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, yes, sorry folks, I cant offer you &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of the cool details of the conversations I&amp;rsquo;m fortunate enough to have, but I think that almost all the confidential-type-stuff is inconsequential to the purpose of this site anyway (things like what new top-secret projects are being worked on, etc.). Certainly interesting, but nothing thats really going to help a newbie understand the industry or how to get into it anymore. Id say I get to share about 95% of what I learn in any particular conversation and another 4% is always covered by some other conversation that doesnt touch on sensitive material anyway. I dont think the last 1% that I cannot readily address while keeping my confidences is all that important, but heck, I gotta leave yall something to learn on your own. ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I digress. Lisa and I spoke about the opportunities at Maxis and throughout EA. She suggested that if I were flexible with my location that there are other studios like EA Redwood Shores, LA, Montreal, Vancouver, Florida, and Texas that also have opportunities. I told her that living in SF is the icing, but working for EA is the cake&amp;ndash;I&amp;rsquo;m ready to move wherever I need to. She filled me in on some of the projects that she believes may be hiring right now and she offered to give me a call tomorrow after she pings a few people at the other studios to see what she can find. I had fun talking to Lisa and I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to hearing from her tomorrow! I know that shes plenty busy&amp;ndash;its really nice of her to help!&lt;/p&gt;

      <pubDate>Tue, 02 Dec 2003 20:23:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ggr.com/a-quick-hello-with-david-de-martini.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href=&#34;https://ggr.com/intro-to-jose-martin.html&#34;&gt;my meeting&lt;/a&gt; with Jose was coming to a close, in walked David De Martini. I had emailed DeMar to try and setup a meeting but we hadn&amp;rsquo;t set anything up yet. Turns out Bing put me on his calendar to his surprise. :p Made me feel pretty cool that &lt;a href=&#34;https://ggr.com/lunch-with-bing-gordon.html&#34;&gt;Bing&lt;/a&gt; got him here on my behalf, but I certainly didn&amp;rsquo;t want to inconvenience DeMar! He offered to reschedule since now wasn&amp;rsquo;t a good time for him to step away and I was happy to accept. We are on for next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that, another great set of meetings at EA was complete. Jenny came in and offered me the remaining food from lunch. I tried to decline the salad, but I only managed avoiding the bags of chips. :) And then off into the sunset and the 101&amp;hellip;until next time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Intro To Jose Martin</title>
      <link>https://ggr.com/intro-to-jose-martin.html</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 02 Dec 2003 19:54:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ggr.com/intro-to-jose-martin.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Apparently Bing asked Jose Martin to meet me after &lt;a href=&#34;https://ggr.com/lunch-with-bing-gordon.html&#34;&gt;Bing and I met&lt;/a&gt;, and there he appeared! Jose is &amp;ldquo;Vice President Human Resources, WW Group Studios&amp;rdquo; which means I couldnt meet someone with a better view of Studios hiring plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started our conversation with the standard questions about my interest in games, my favorites, etc. and then I started in with some questions of my own. I asked what makes the difference between a good producer and a great producer and he said there were three areas where a great producer excels:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creative: He has a clear vision of the game he wants to make, he is confident in himself and his vision, and he is effective at communicating his vision to everyone on the team in all their different roles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Management: He is an effective project and people manager with the skills that enable him to lead his team to realize his vision and consistently produce high quality products on-time and on-budget.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Business and people: He can readily distinguish between good ideas that are commercially viable and those that are not. He has a good sense of the market. He is a good leader&amp;ndash;he selects outstanding team members and he motivates and helps each of them to great personal achievements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jose encouraged me to attend the next GDC and I mentioned that I was already planning to go as a panelist with the IGDA&amp;rsquo;s QoL group. He thought that was an excellent idea and a great way of opening doors and meeting more people in the industry. Jose asked me some more about my background and then offered to answer more question to see how he could help. I asked him how I should be directing my efforts so that I can start and build a career at EA in production with the long term goal of exec producer in mind. He said that he felt I was doing the right things already and to keep doing what I&amp;rsquo;m doing&amp;ndash;he&amp;rsquo;s going to see what he can do on his end but he thinks it really just a matter of timing and being patient as the hiring cycles come around. Then he offered me some &lt;em&gt;excellent&lt;/em&gt; tactical ideas to help me in my interviews and help me to gain some experience while I&amp;rsquo;m still interviewing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leave material with my interviewers that provide solid evidence of my ability and experience in each of the three pillars, as they come up in the interview. Doing so demonstrates that I&amp;rsquo;m prepared, I&amp;rsquo;ve done my homework, and I have applicable, valuable experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask the people I meet with what their biggest challenges are and what they wish they had more bandwidth to work on. The first question could potentially reveal areas I&amp;rsquo;m especially well equipped to help with &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; that would instantly turn me into an asset. The second question is more likely to highlight areas that are easier to address, but are more time intensive. With those I might find something I can volunteer to help with in order to get the experience and maybe to trade for mentoring. A lot of producers, for example, just never can find the time to play all the games they want to play as competitive research. I could help them out by doing the research for them and looking for the specific things they want to find. Like the top three original design innovations in each game, for example. I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting a way to spend more time with the producers I&amp;rsquo;ve met so that I can learn from them but I hadn&amp;rsquo;t yet come up with a way to do it that would be a mutual benefit. This is perfect!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;rsquo;s about the time my next surprise walked in: David De Martini. I said goodbye to Jose after a thoroughly informative meeting and I said &lt;a href=&#34;https://ggr.com/a-quick-hello-with-david-de-martini.html&#34;&gt;hello to DeMar&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So the other day I&amp;rsquo;m in 250&amp;hellip; :) After chatting with Tara I headed over to the front desk to let Jenny Turick (&lt;a href=&#34;https://ggr.com/lunch-with-bing-gordon.html&#34;&gt;Bing&lt;/a&gt;s exec assistant) know I was here. That is, the front desk of &lt;em&gt;death&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Front Desk Puzzle &amp;rsquo; 10 points&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed, after about 4 visits, that when the front desk calls someone and tells me that they have confirmed that they know I&amp;rsquo;m in 250 it can actually mean one of a few different things: a) they left a message for someone other than the person I&amp;rsquo;m supposed to meet with, b) they left a message for the person I&amp;rsquo;m supposed to meet with, c) they talked to someone who doesnt know who I am, doesnt care, and is not coming down to see me, d) they talked to the right person and they are actually coming right down. It&amp;rsquo;s like a test to see if you can figure out how to actually be on time to a meeting in that building. ;) On this occasion I started 10 minutes early&amp;ndash;at 5 late I asked the front desk to make certain they had called Jenny and she had actually &lt;em&gt;said&lt;/em&gt; she was coming down. At 10 minutes late I overhear them pick up the phone and apparently tell Jenny that, yes, there was someone down here named Scott Bonds. Heh heh. The moral of the story is that if you have a meeting in 250, call the person you are meeting yourself. Were all gamers here, think of it as the first puzzle for gaining entry into the main dungeon. ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb About Bing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I followed Jenny to one of the meeting rooms and she offered to grab me some lunch since she was picking some up for Bing already. Its one of the perks of meeting with a top EA exec, free sandwich. :) To provide some context here, Bing is a serious badass. Hes one of two of the 7 original founders of EA (back in 1982) who still works at EA. Hes basically a legend&amp;hellip;I mean, EA is a $13B public company these days and its the #1 games publisher in the world. And its just getting started. Bing has been here since day 1 and has played a key role in marketing and strategy for the company. So yah, I was a little nervous meeting with the guy. ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Down To Business&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bing soon walks in and we start talking about games. We talk about a lot of the standard stuff&amp;ndash;I tell him what games I&amp;rsquo;m playing, what interests me about the industry and EA specifically, and what my favorite games of all time are. I ask him for his advice about how I should go about finding a place at EA and he suggests that I&amp;rsquo;m doing the right thing&amp;ndash;the key is going to be patience. There are certain hiring cycles and timing needs to be right. Right place at the right time. Since I&amp;rsquo;m doing a reasonable job at getting visibility everywhere in EA and I&amp;rsquo;m someone with lots of potential its more a matter of time. Bing notes that &lt;a href=&#34;https://ggr.com/sit-down-with-neil-young.html&#34;&gt;Neil&lt;/a&gt; told him that he thinks EA should definitely hire me, which is why he suggested Bing and I meet. I was like, wow, thats really awesome of Neil! I guess thats basically what he said in his email after we met&amp;hellip;I just read it more conservatively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EA does hire badasses on the spot regardless of cycles, but apparently they dont do that for newbies&amp;ndash;a badass must necessarily already have game experience. Though, he did mention that DeMar came from biz software like me, but I dont know if he was on-the-spot hired from there. No, on-the-spots sound like they are reserved for exec producer-types. They are a rarer commodity that justify that risk I suppose! I wondered what youd have to look like as a newbie to actually get hired that way&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bing quickly understood my challenges so far&amp;ndash;since I had experience, but not game experience I was a little harder to match against the traditional entry points for the production path. He said I have the right experience that would make me a great executive producer (I have the business, entrepreneurial, and technical experience) but I was missing the third tier, creative design experience with games. He said EA would love to have more rockstar, early 30s exec producers, but so far only people with 10-15 years of experience in the industry have seemed right for the role and that is creating some problems since they dont have enough exec producers. He says that Neil Young is a rockstar and hes an excellent mentor for the next generation of leaders. And I&amp;rsquo;m thinking, dude, I&amp;rsquo;m so there, I just need to figure out how to get started. Neil sounds like hed be awesome to work with if I get the chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next steps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Bing started brainstorming people I should meet. Met with Neil, should meet with Glen Scofield, with &lt;a href=&#34;https://ggr.com/this-ungodly-hour.html&#34;&gt;Chris Plummer&lt;/a&gt;, should meet with DeMar who has a similar entry background (and hes kicked some ass with Tiger Woods), should meet with Arcadia who came mid-career from film and who is a rising star on Neils team. Neil used to be LOTR but he groomed a couple people and handed those off&amp;ndash;now hes doing high-level big-idea projects&amp;ndash;probably looking for people that can execute on some really creative new ideas. That sounds awesome. I&amp;rsquo;m taking furious notes, making sure I know who I need to talk to next. And then Jose Martin walks in the room and Bing introduces me to the VP of HR for EA Studios. But that story is for &lt;a href=&#34;https://ggr.com/intro-to-jose-martin.html&#34;&gt;another post&lt;/a&gt;. :)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While Tara and I &lt;a href=&#34;https://ggr.com/sit-down-with-tara-s.html&#34;&gt;chatted&lt;/a&gt; away Philip Gee walked by and Tara quickly introduced us. Phil handles college recruiting for EA and Tara wanted to see if he might have some ideas. I&amp;rsquo;ve been out of college too long for his department, nevertheless he offered to fill me in on which teams he knows of that are hiring producers right now and what the calendar looks like. He pointed out that in December, after the big Christmas push in October, a lot of the teams are working on their pilots with a small team of artists and developers. They are getting ready to pitch their new project before they ramp up the entire team in Q1 on the new year. Nevertheless, there are other teams that are entirely new or are otherwise on a different calendar cycle. Good stuff! Thank you email on its way.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Weve been meeting to get together and swap stories and it finally happened today right before my &lt;a href=&#34;https://ggr.com/lunch-with-bing-gordon.html&#34;&gt;meeting&lt;/a&gt; with Bing. I was wandering the area that the geese had marked as their own (at least, I think the dropping saturate sidewalk must be a popular hangout for them) when &lt;a href=&#34;https://ggr.com/a-couple-shout-outs.html&#34;&gt;Tara&lt;/a&gt; called and we converged on 250 to talk. Tara made sure to introduce me to everyone she could along the path from the front of the building to the cushy chairs, because shes just cool that way. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tara is a kindred spirit, having mounted a serious effort of her own to join the EA team. A number of months ago she had decided she wanted to get in the game industry. A few interviews at EA convinced her that she &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; wanted to get into the game industry&amp;ndash;she had the same sort of a-ha moment when she kept bumping into the immensely talent, fun people that one is prone to meet at EA. She kept interviewing with other companies even a few in other industries. And while the offers kept coming in, Tara had left her heart in Redwood Shores. She declined these jobs in favor ofno job(!) so she could keep interviewing with EA. She racked up some debt in order to finance her effort to learn about and become part of the EA team&amp;ndash;it only made her more determined to find a place at EA where she could contribute. I&amp;rsquo;m happy to report that she has an @ea.com at the end of her email address and though shes on contract in marketing for Bond right now, I suspect that her enthusiasm for EA will help her find a permanent place at EA. I know I&amp;rsquo;ll be cheering her on!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated on June 8th, 2015&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abbreviated Tara&amp;rsquo;s name at her request.&lt;/p&gt;

      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2003 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ggr.com/the-swedish-connection.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago I heard from Fredrik Thylander (a game designer with &lt;a href=&#34;http://dice.se/&#34;&gt;Digital I&amp;rsquo;llusions&lt;/a&gt;) who had stumbled across this site and sent me an email just to say he likes the site and good luck. He also put a good word in for &lt;a href=&#34;https://ggr.com/first-interview.html&#34;&gt;John Vifian&lt;/a&gt; and EAP&amp;ndash;good bunch of guys to work with. Today I heard from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId=11359/&#34;&gt;Sean Decker&lt;/a&gt; who, it turns out, is over in Sweden working with a team on the Battlefield series. I know that Fredrik is working on the series too. Heh heh, small world. Man, I would &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; to work in Sweden, I&amp;rsquo;m very jealous of these guys. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Central to Fredriks advice on what makes a good producer was the need to articulate a clear vision to each of the teams so that they know what to build. He suggests it is better to be overly specific with what you want, lest each team build something else that doesnt fit what you expect, creating problems when it comes time to put them together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was introduced to Sean Decker through &lt;a href=&#34;https://ggr.com/conversation-with-tiffany.html&#34;&gt;Tiffany Spencer&lt;/a&gt;&amp;ndash;I had asked her if she know any producers I could talk to and she offered to make an introduction to her friend Sean. Sean was a producer on the SimCity series. Hes in Sweden working on Battlefield at the momenthell be back in a couple weeks and were going to meet up then.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>On I&#39;mmersion And Tron 2.0</title>
      <link>https://ggr.com/on-immersion-and-tron-2.0.html</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 30 Nov 2003 01:16:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ggr.com/on-immersion-and-tron-2.0.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I just finished &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/tron-20&#34;&gt;Tron 2.0&lt;/a&gt; and prior to that by a few days I had watched the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00009TB5G/qid=1070186348/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/104-7998853-1870303?v=glance&amp;amp;s=dvd&amp;amp;n=507846&#34;&gt;Two Towers, extended version&lt;/a&gt; and its appendices. I find the making of the LOTR movies and Peter Jackson as a supreme inspiration&amp;ndash;and it reminds me of what I&amp;rsquo;m looking for in game production. I want to help bottle the awe and joy of those moments I&amp;rsquo;ve found in books and on screen and bring them to games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every time I&amp;rsquo;ve been asked about which game genre I like the most I&amp;rsquo;ve answered that I&amp;rsquo;m not a genre specific person&amp;ndash;I want to experience and create immersion. I want to become part of a story world and live the compelling story of a main character within a plot of consequence and wonders. I&amp;rsquo;ve found that sense of complete immersion in FPS, RTS, and some other games that dont fit that well into any conventional genre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The I&amp;rsquo;mmersion Guy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve started to wonder whose job it is to work on the immersion factor. It seems like it would be a director in a film and perhaps a producer in the world of games, but I need to learn more about the creative process behind games and how they evolve from the seed of an idea to a concept, to a funded project, to a design, to a prototype and on through to the complete project. I&amp;rsquo;ve got some impression of the outline process and it seems rather project and studio dependent to me, but I really want to learn more about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it would be a really fun job to be the guy that works on taking a game like Tron 2.0 from a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.metacritic.com/about-metascores&#34;&gt;Metacritic&lt;/a&gt; 80s to a Metacritic 90s game. Sorta the &amp;lsquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0066620996/qid=1070187477/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/104-7998853-1870303?v=glance&amp;amp;n=507846&#34;&gt;good to great&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo; guy&amp;ndash;maybe called the creative director/editor, or the game-play writer (like a screenplay). Maybe that would be a good game designer practice project&amp;ndash;take a game that has already been made and redo the levels, characters, and stories through modding to create a new single-player game that fixes where you think the game should have been made differently from a story perspective. Tron 2.0 suffered from a common problem I find in a lot of games&amp;ndash;its excellent on all the technical points but the story is flat and the elements that might have immerse the player in Tron&amp;rsquo;s world failed to come together. I&amp;rsquo;m thinking maybe I could dodge a lot of technical rework and focus on recutting the story and sound and come up with a much better game in a reasonable amount of time (say, 500 hours).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How About Game Writing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe what I would really like to be is a game writer. I imagine a game writer would share more in common with D&amp;amp;D module writers than film writers while sharing elements of each. On the one hand writing for games is like module writing inasmuch as you must create a story and story world that can accommodate, incorporate, and react to player actions. On the other hand, since you dont have a live GM there to roleplay on behalf of the NPCs and the world, you have to build a script for the major events and characters that is ultimately linear. The unique task of the game writer is to bring those two elements together in a manner that hides the true nature of the game from the player such that they never reach the edge of the world&amp;ndash;they never feel constrained in their action to some linear plot while not being left unmotivated or marginalized from the main storyline(s).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that game writing is too often being short changed&amp;ndash;perhaps being handled by producers with too many other things to do and little writing talent or training (if any) to draw upon. Perhaps they outline the major plot line and describe the characters and then jump right into making a game engine and some artwork. But leaving the backstory, the story, the world, and the character to the end or to non-writers renders them flat. Writing and world building are difficult and important skills that can really make or break a game&amp;ndash;I wish it were treated more seriously than it seems to be. And no, I&amp;rsquo;m not talking about RPGs here. I&amp;rsquo;m talking about games like Tron 2.0 and &lt;a href=&#34;https://ggr.com/homeworld-2-notes.html&#34;&gt;Homeworld 2.0&lt;/a&gt; that missed out on being great games because, IMHO, they didnt get the writing right. I dont have any writing training or experience myself but the more I think about what role Id like to eventually play the more I think I really need to start studying creative writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ideas for Tron 2.1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if I were to rewrite Tron 2.0s story, leaving its engine the way it is, what would I do? A couple things, I think&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start in the game&amp;ndash;forget the initial cut scene. The starting cut scene is sorta like reading a manual&amp;hellip;I think most people would enjoy diving right in, though they may be a little disoriented at first. I liked how &lt;a href=&#34;https://ggr.com/aps-and-morrowind.html&#34;&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; starts out with you in character and I though the prologue-type gameplay at the beginning of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox/fatal-frame&#34;&gt;Fatal Frame&lt;/a&gt; was a great idea. Half-Life started that way too&amp;ndash;you are just a normal guy going to work at an unusual place for what you expect is a normal work day and then the shit hits the fan. You dont really do much, but you are in character and you do get a chance to walk around and check things out a bit. I like the idea of getting the player in the game quickly just as you would in a movie. Maybe even a Bond style prologue packed with action to draw the player in right off the bat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take out saved games. Well, maybe. ;) I think saving and loading games does a lot to remove one from the immersive feel of a game. I was pretty scared when I played through Fatal Frame, but the die-reload-die-reload cycles took me out of the game-world and hurt the game. On the other hand, a writer must respect the player expectations for form within the game or risk losing the audience. I mean, I get pissed when I cant save a game for a long time. Its disorienting and frustrating, especially if I die and have to replay a long segment&amp;ndash;at least in part because its repetitive. I like the idea of integrating incapacitation into game play like Prince of Persia: Sand of Time sorta does. What I would do is have it so that each time you die, it affects the plot in some way and you recover somewhere else. It cant be a punishment or the player will get frustrated&amp;ndash;it has to be interesting and fun&amp;hellip;and it cant be repetitive if the player dies more than once. In fact, maybe we could remove the difficulty selection entirely and have the game adjust itself based upon how well you are doing. I also like the idea of taking out the health bar and replacing it with indicators of the damage. Like sparks coming off your lega limp, trouble throwing your disc, blurry vision, etc. Things that add to you immersion and subtract from how many things you need to keep track of.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dont auto-popup the help files&amp;ndash;find another way to integrate tutorial-like material into the gameplay. The help-files interrupt the flow of the game and slow things down. I think Tron 2.0 and games in general could learn a lesson or two in pacing from film editors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Different story. I just didnt dig the story they came up with&amp;ndash;seemed a bit kitch to me. I thought it should be a bit more subtle&amp;ndash;less cartoony, maybe a bit grittier, a bit darker. It felt like Batman 3 rather than Batman 1, and that was a bad thing. This, however, is very easy to &lt;em&gt;say&lt;/em&gt; and very hard to &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt;. This is where most of the work needs to be done&amp;ndash;I&amp;rsquo;m going to think about this some more and see if I can come up with a module outline that I like.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>No One Lives Forever Notes</title>
      <link>https://ggr.com/no-one-lives-forever-notes.html</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2003 00:18:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ggr.com/no-one-lives-forever-notes.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, its a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/the-operative-no-one-lives-forever&#34;&gt;top rated&lt;/a&gt; game so I thought Id check out what its all about. I opted not to read the reviews first and just let it impress me on its own. Of course, the graphics are a little dated, but I liked &lt;a href=&#34;https://ggr.com/alice-notes.html&#34;&gt;Alice&lt;/a&gt; a lot and its getting a little long in the tooth. My favorite games have survived a graphics cycle or two and are still fun in any case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What I Liked&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cool settings (settings like the bottom of the ocean, not settings like an on-off button) and level design&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A female hero that even a feminist could like&amp;ndash;shes smart, good looking, capable, and anatomically possible. Though there is a nude hack for the teenage boys in the audience. ;) Not that I know anything about that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The theme of a woman battling to make it in a chauvinistic organization was kinda cool and even educational (or propagandist depending on your perspectiveI liked it in any case). Goes to show that games can have more to them than entertainment value. Reminded me that our society still has some glass ceilings lying around. I wonder how many women are on &lt;a href=&#34;http://investors.ea.com/directors.cfm&#34;&gt;EA&amp;rsquo;s board&lt;/a&gt;&amp;hellip;checking&amp;hellip;looks like 1 in 8. And shes in marketing, of course. :p Heh heh, if a game can inspire me to check that out, thats saying something.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I loved the progressive introduction of new gadgets and the way they integrated training seamlessly into the game. The training moved a bit slow for my tastes, but pretty cool nonetheless.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Had some elements of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/thief-the-dark-project&#34;&gt;Thief&lt;/a&gt;&amp;ndash;you could get a lot done by sneaking around, but you could also whip out a gun and raise some hell. Shooting things up can get you through the level faster&amp;ndash;just depends on what you are in the mood for.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What I Didnt Dig As Much&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The story felt a bit thin. The odd thing was it was interwoven with the action pretty well&amp;hellip;maybe it was the fact that I kept getting pulled out of the field and back into the office. Made it difficult for me to immerse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Little sense of momentum. I would walk somewhere, do something, and then I could go into a room and sit there for 30 minutes if I wanted. No external force kept me moving forward. As a counterexample, if I sat around in Homeworld, Id get my ass kicked. Half-Life you could sit around though. Hmm There was &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; more compelling about HL though&amp;ndash;maybe it was that there were more scripted events lying around. I&amp;rsquo;ll have to ponder this one a little more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve just bought a bunch of new games to try out, so I stopped after the first 10 missions or so. I just wasnt getting drawn into the game, but I&amp;rsquo;ll probably come back and finish it off. I like to play games all the way through even though they I find a lot of games seem to be front loaded with best gameplay (take Unreal2 single-player, for example).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>First EA App Complete</title>
      <link>https://ggr.com/first-ea-app-complete.html</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2003 23:37:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ggr.com/first-ea-app-complete.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Heard from &lt;a href=&#34;https://ggr.com/the-campaign-begins.html&#34;&gt;Rob Moreno&lt;/a&gt; today letting me know that EAP isn&amp;rsquo;t ready to bring me on just yet. Darn! I was hoping that they would see past my lack of game industry experience but it looks like they noticed. ;) So that wraps my &lt;a href=&#34;https://ggr.com/6-hours-of-interviews.html&#34;&gt;first&lt;/a&gt; formal application to a position with EA! Not too shabby&amp;ndash;I made 5 new production contacts, several of whom were kind enough to offer me help after the interview was over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vibe I got from my conversation with Rob this afternoon was that EAP may not be as well equipped as Studio to take on an industry newbie like myself&amp;ndash;EAP has 3-5 people on a team managing an external development studio whereas Studio can have as many as 200 people on a project. Gives Studio more resources with which to mentor people like me. It may also afford me greater learning opportunities simply because I would be surrounded by a lot more activity on a daily basis. That isnt to say there wont be other opportunities at EAP that would be a good fit for what I can bring to the party right now&amp;hellip;only time will tell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My original guess was that it would take me about 3-5 interview-level-applications within the industry before I&amp;rsquo;m likely to land my first offer. I figure I&amp;rsquo;m a bit of an anomaly (neither a workplace newbie nor a game industry veteran) so it will take me that much longer to practice my interview skills, become familiar with the positions, and become comfortable with the process. I (of course) was hoping Id be able to hit a home run on my first at bat, but ya know, I&amp;rsquo;m pretty happy with the double. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The campaign continues! I&amp;rsquo;ve got a couple informational interviews lined up next week and I&amp;rsquo;m going to follow up with the EAP guys to see if they might be willing to introduce me to some new faces Studio side&amp;hellip;maybe give some tips on how to be even better prepared for my next opportunity with EA. The guys at EALA mentioned that they are ramping up as they bring the new office online in January as well. All that is to say I&amp;rsquo;ve got my work cut out for me. ;)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I feel very lucky to have been introduced to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,11/&#34;&gt;Bing Gordon&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;https://ggr.com/sit-down-with-neil-young.html&#34;&gt;Neil Young&lt;/a&gt;. Bing has offered to meet with me in a week and a half where well no doubt have the chance to speak about a number of interesting topics. Id love to hear the tales he has from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ggr.com/the-ea-way.html&#34;&gt;early days&lt;/a&gt; of EAhes one of the 7 original founders from back in 1982. That makes him one of the rock stars of the industry&amp;hellip;I can hardly believe I get to sit down with him! Its going to be awesome. I feel like I&amp;rsquo;m going up to the mountain and meeting the guru to learn who-knows-what pearls of wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Some Thank You Cards</title>

      <guid>https://ggr.com/some-thank-you-cards.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I thought it would be nice to thank everyone I met with during the course of my &lt;a href=&#34;https://ggr.com/6-hours-of-interviews.html&#34;&gt;interviews&lt;/a&gt;. I learned a lot and a number of people even offered their business cards and told me to call or email if I had more questions. Thank yous are definitely in order! I was thinking about sending emails, but I decided on personalize hand-written thank you cards. I think cards convey greater appreciation and courtesy because they take more effort. I like to send them promptly too&amp;ndash;I think it better conveys my respect and sincerity when its prompt. So, I just spent an hour writing and addressing cards to each of the 10 people I met. Now I am off to drive them to the post office so that they will begin their journey towards Redwood City first thing Saturday morning. And then some sleep. :)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>In-person Interviews With EAP, Round</title>
      <link>https://ggr.com/in-person-interviews-with-eap-round.html</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2003 23:32:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ggr.com/in-person-interviews-with-eap-round.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Its been quite a day! 5 hours of interviews stacked back-to-back with a bunch of the EAP team&amp;hellip;and this is just the first round of in-person interviews. These were proceeded by two &lt;a href=&#34;https://ggr.com/first-interview.html&#34;&gt;phone interviews&lt;/a&gt; a couple weeks ago. It was pretty cool meeting everyone and having the chance to ask a lot of questions about EA and the production roles here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Craig Alexander told me the reason for the high number of interviews was that EA is very consensus oriented&amp;ndash;I will be working with a lot of people very closely under a lot of pressure and it&amp;rsquo;s important that everyone get along really well. It sounds like a good idea to me. And I get 10 more people to ask about EA and learn more of the culture and way or working at my game company of choice. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each interview was roughly a 45 minute one-on-one interview. I met producers and DDs of various ranks and interests. I received the &amp;ldquo;why its cool to work here&amp;rdquo; packet from HR. The questions asked of me seemed geared to gauge my passion for games more than my knowledge of them or my knowledge in general. I suspect they were already ready to assume (based on my resume) that I was at least a somewhat intelligent guy&amp;ndash;the important question was whether I would be a fit and how much potential would I realize once I&amp;rsquo;m a part of the team. There was also a lot of personality probing I think&amp;ndash;just wanting to see if I&amp;rsquo;m a guy they could hang with or not. The one repeat question I got though was &amp;ldquo;why do you want to work at EA,&amp;rdquo; which was to be expected, considering this website. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I explained that I want to work at EA because the people I&amp;rsquo;ve met have been helpful to an unusual degree, they have seemed to me smarter and more focused than other game companies, EA has an unrivaled grasp of the power of franchise, EA is the largest independent publisher of games in the US, EA doesn&amp;rsquo;t do hardware, only games, it seems like a kick ass place to work, and there are opportunities for a motivate guy like myself to make a difference and grow with the company. I haven&amp;rsquo;t scripted my answer, so it varies a bit each time, focusing more on this or that aspect of EA, but I think I got the idea across that I had really thought that question through before I created this website and started to focus on EA as my #1 choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Craig and a couple of the other people I met with mentioned this website. Although few had had a chance to look at it to any great extent, they liked that it demonstrated creativity and drive. Craig told me that it&amp;rsquo;s refreshing to meet people that really want to get into the industry and work for EA with a passion. I had managed to get my message across to a lot of the right people and it&amp;rsquo;s the right message. I was thinking: this is so cool&amp;ndash;they like it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At about 6:15p we wrapped things up and I left EA to go ponder the day and enjoy a Friday evening in the Bay Area. Overall I felt pretty happy with the way things went. I felt that I had put by best foot forward. Or at least a good foot. ;) In my head I reviewed the recruitment process as I understood it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EAPs recruiters go through a bunch of resumes and find 40 they want to phone interview at least once.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first interview is conducted with each of the 40.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Of those 40, about 20 make it to the second phone interview.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Of those 20, about 10 make it to the first round of 8 in-person interviews.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Of those 10, about 2 make it to the second round of in-person interviews.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EAP decided at that point whether to make some offers or not.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So a lot rides on whether I made a good impression and even if I did manage that I am competing with talented internal EA applicants as well as more experienced external applicants. Besides &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; there is the question of whether the timing is right for what they need and what I can offer. Basically, I have no idea how I&amp;rsquo;m doing. ;) But was told I should find out around Tuesday of next week, after everyone powwows and decides whether I make the cut for the second round interviews. I can honestly say that its been a real pleasure to make it even this far in the process&amp;ndash;I&amp;rsquo;ve had a chance to meet some incredible people and learn a bunch about EA. I cant complain however it goes. But I&amp;rsquo;m keeping my fingers crossed!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Chat With Ofer Estline</title>
      <link>https://ggr.com/chat-with-ofer-estline.html</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2003 22:19:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ggr.com/chat-with-ofer-estline.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ofer and I met at EALA after work (well, not really, Ofer planned to stay until midnight) to talk about EA and Development Directors (DDs). First a quick tour of EALA which is presently packed with three studios. Its nice and cozy until January when the new offices come online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked Ofer to tell me more about DD vs Producers at EA. I&amp;rsquo;ve heard the story from a couple Producers, but Ofer is the first DD I&amp;rsquo;ve had a chance to sit down with. He explained that the DD role is reserved for those proficient in the art of management&amp;ndash;of people and projects. The DDs does stuff like write up the reviews, assign the tasks, manage the schedules, assign office space, and resolve disputes. They take the vision for the game from the Producer and make it happen. The DD role was split off from the producer and developer roles in order to allow these roles to be focused on design and programming respectively. That way, if you are a whiz programmer you can advance on a career track where you become a guru (technical director) without needing to become a manager and deal with all the new skill areas that such a move requires. Brilliant idea if you ask me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ofer suggested that EA might benefit from having someone like me focused on what I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing before joining EA&amp;ndash;automation and process optimization through software. He pointed out that someone with a knowledge management background like mine could probably have a big impact at a place like EA which does not yet manage and take advantage of its information resources as well is it might. I was reminded of a conversation I had with Jordon&amp;ndash;I had asked about how EA manages code reuse and licensing its code to 3rd parties. It didnt sound like there was any particular team managing EA&amp;rsquo;s code assets, it was all sort of random sharing whenever sharing happened at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ofer said the road to producer may be long and suggested I look into building a KM-styled role at EA, perhaps starting with a production title or attached to a studio, but with a KM mission. It&amp;rsquo;s an intriguing ideamaybe I&amp;rsquo;ll ask Bing about it when I meet him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked what he thought of EAP and Ofer pointed out that EAP is more business and deal focused than Studio-side, as it&amp;rsquo;s focused on performing through 3rd parties rather than through game production alone. With that it was time for me to head out and let Ofer continue his work&amp;ndash;and I&amp;rsquo;ve got some interviews with EAP to prep for myself.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The EA Way</title>
      <link>https://ggr.com/the-ea-way.html</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2003 09:48:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While I was visiting &lt;a href=&#34;https://ggr.com/bond-and-jordan-maynard.html&#34;&gt;Jordan Maynard&lt;/a&gt; last week, I noticed an old EA advertisement framed on his desk. It was a sort of manifesto for EA that defined what EA was about and told why it mattered. Even though some people may think of EA as more business oriented than a lot of smaller game companies, I think the founders articulated a vision that still captures the underlying spirit of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://chrishecker.com/Can_a_Computer_Make_You_Cry%3F&#34;&gt;company&lt;/a&gt; and the industry: yes, money keeps the ball rolling, but at the end of the day we are not just creating a way to have fun&amp;ndash;we are participating in a cultural and artistic conversation about ourselves and our world. Jordan was kind enough to make me a copy and I think its worth sharing. Here is the ad published in the September 1983 issue of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.scientificamerican.com/&#34;&gt;Scientific American&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ggr_com.s3.amazonaws.com/images/cry.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;4&#34; title=&#34;EA&#39;s &#39;can a computer make you cry&#39; magazine ad. #fullwidth&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Online Networking</title>
      <link>https://ggr.com/online-networking.html</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2003 16:53:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ggr.com/online-networking.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was recently asked how online networking tools like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.spoke.com/&#34;&gt;Spoke&lt;/a&gt; have contributed to my efforts to meet people within the game industry. I signed up for Spoke, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/&#34;&gt;Linked-In&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendster&#34;&gt;Friendster&lt;/a&gt;, and couple others a few months ago. But none of them were much help for meeting people in the game industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whats Missing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I havent met many people in the game industry that choose to spend a lot of time on networking&amp;ndash;it sorta happens during the course of working in the industry but the industry is otherwise a bit insulated. It seems that game makers have less of a need for active networking than the practitioners of other entertainment industries. If you are actor, for example, attention is your currency. If you are game programmer or an animator, networking is still important, but an active networking hobby isnt as central to a successful career. There are people who are exceptions to the rule, and I &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt; operating off very little data so far, but thats the initial look of things to me. Most of the people I talk to tell me they got into the industry through a friend; yet when I asked my friend Auren (who knows half the people in San Francisco) he had trouble naming &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; game contacts off the top of his head. The online networking tools didnt do much better&amp;ndash;just not that many game people in there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, I suspect that people dont feel comfortable giving these online networks all of their personal information. I, for one, just dont feel comfortable &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.satirewire.com/briefs/mci.shtml&#34;&gt;telling MCI&lt;/a&gt; who all my friends are. ;) Or anyone else for that matter. I dont trust them to use my information exclusively in a manner I would want the information used, I dont trust their internally or externally oriented security controls, and I like to be in the driver seat when it comes to something as personal as who I know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Networking Tool That a Game Designer Could Love, Maybe&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, a couple weeks ago I deleted all my info and closed all my accounts to be reconsidered some other day. Perhaps once a clear winner in the online networking game has emerged, though I suspect these things will go away or turn into CRM tools sold to commercial interests. My gut tells me that theres something wrong with all of these models, but who knows? Maybe they will evolve into something interesting, its worth keeping an eye on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After sitting down to think through why these systems didnt work, I decided to think through how a system could work that I and my friends would use. And I came up with an idea that I think in a little closer to how people already do things&amp;hellip;but with the benefit of a technology boost: a P2P app that integrates with Outlook and allows you to share your contacts with your friends. It would work something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You and your friends install the app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You and your friends exchange secure public keys so each of you can securely accept requests from each other.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You decide you want to meet someone that works at EA. You run a query. It sends the request to your friends. Their copy of the app looks to see if they know anyone that meets you criteria. If one is found, you get a response that says your friend knows someone and you should get in touch with your friend for further info. If one isnt found, your request is forwarded to their friends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Control over who you trust with what amounts of information, how many levels away you will respond to and how, etc. is controlled by each individual participant. The data is always under their complete control, it never resides anywhere else. Essentially you don&amp;rsquo;t have to change how you network at all&amp;ndash;the tool simply facilitates the same interaction you would do without its help. No giving away the crown jewels before you get to play and no dependence on some third party to network with your friends. Heck, the thing could be a plug-in that sits on top of an IM client.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s how I would do it. Who knows, maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll get around to building it sometime. ;) &lt;a href=&#34;http://web.archive.org/web/20040609092504/http://www.huminity.com/&#34;&gt;Huminity&lt;/a&gt; is the closest to this concept that I&amp;rsquo;ve seen. There is probably money to be made in the centralized contact sharing business, but I&amp;rsquo;m placing my $5 bet that the P2P, decentralized model wins the most users over the next 5 years. It may even turn out to be the better money maker.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>6 Hours Of Interviews</title>
      <link>https://ggr.com/6-hours-of-interviews.html</link>

      <guid>https://ggr.com/6-hours-of-interviews.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Got the email packet for my EAP interviews this week and I note that its going to be a marathon of 30 to 45 minute interviews. I&amp;rsquo;ll get the chance to meet a lot of the people I would be working with and I&amp;rsquo;ll have an opportunity to meet all the different titles I want to learn more about&amp;ndash;Associate Development Director (DD), Associate Producer (AP), Producer, Senior Producer, VP. Thats some serious interviewing though! I feel like I should run up a hill and eat broccoli the day before or something. :) The gig I&amp;rsquo;m hoping for is an Assistant Producer role with EAP. I saw Scott Evans on the interview list. I &lt;a href=&#34;https://ggr.com/system-shock-3.html&#34;&gt;emailed&lt;/a&gt; him a while back about System Shock 2 which he produced. Its going to be pretty cool to meet him in person and to know that I might get to work with someone that made one of the best games ever, IMHO.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>APs and Morrowind</title>
      <link>https://ggr.com/aps-and-morrowind.html</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 16 Nov 2003 21:26:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ggr.com/aps-and-morrowind.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Met up with my friend &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1828266/?ref_=fn_al_nm_3&#34;&gt;Aaron Butler&lt;/a&gt; for lunch. Hes an Associate Producer with MTV and hes earned credits for editing and directing as well. Hes had some offers from VH1 too&amp;ndash;basically hes totally kicking butt down here. We used to be roommates and before that we were involved in &lt;a href=&#34;http://asuc.org/&#34;&gt;student government&lt;/a&gt; together at Cal. Aarons been making films for the absolute love of it since he was in junior high&amp;ndash;seeing him doing so well is really cool. We sat down to eat and soon got to talking about the differences between production roles in TV, film, and games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Didnt get too deep into it, but some TV jobs have a lot more research while games have a technology angle thats unique to our format. And there is one level even lower than AP in TV: PA (personal assistant). None too glorious a role, but still a great way to meet people and game some exposure to how things work. What all of these entertainment industries share in common is how important meeting people and keeping in touch are. Aaron I both do our homework before meeting someone new to see who we might know in common&amp;ndash;just check on MobyGames for the credits and see who is on there that is familiar. Its pretty cool to be able to do a little name dropping and get the conversation going. Often I learn something funny about an old friend too. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5 Years Of the Wrong Experience&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weve both bumped into the challenge of getting a gig where we didnt have enough of the right kind of experience for an entry-level role, yet the people hiring feel we are too experienced &lt;em&gt;generally&lt;/em&gt; speaking to fit the entry-level role. Catch-22! They are concerned that a more experienced person wont do as well because they might be unhappy about serving in a less glorious role. The way around that seems to be giving the hiring manager the chance to see that were absolutely serious and interested in the role because we want to learn and perform our best. We dont give a crap what the title is, were here for love of the work and the people. Heck, I&amp;rsquo;m having fun just applying for jobs. :) I havent met this many cool people in such a short time, like, ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How To Make a Video&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I told Aaron I&amp;rsquo;ve been mulling the idea of making a parody of a campaign video either Flash or with video. Sorta to go with the campaign theme of this website, but mostly just for fun. I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing with video and audio editing tools lately and I think it would cool to put together a video from scratch. After editing my friend Ritus skydive video (we jumped a few months ago) I starting thinking I should ask Aaron how he edits footage&amp;ndash;I mean, I figured there must be a better way than what I had just stumbled upon while playing with the tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aaron tells me the most important things to keep in mind when editing video is the &amp;ldquo;Yes, but&amp;rdquo; concept and the importance of dissimilar cuts. &amp;ldquo;Yes, but&amp;rdquo; is the idea that you want to say something, add tension with the next cut, then take tension away, then add it again to provide momentum and keep the viewer&amp;rsquo;s interest. When you cut to a new scene, its also important that the new scene is different looking. You dont want to cut from a headshot to another headshot. It isnt attention grabbing and it has the possibility to be confusing. And we didnt even get to talking about the specifics of how to index scenes and decide on how to integrate clips! Heh heh, its kinda cool that each area has so much too it. Aaron is an Avid guy, I saw that the Bond team uses Final Cut Pro for their video editing. I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing with Vegas after finding Premiere a bit too unstable on my setup for my taste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometime soon Aaron wants to put up a website for his work, which would be nice&amp;ndash;I&amp;rsquo;ll be helping out with my mad programmer skills, or course. ;) I need to get copies of his footage so I can hold a meeting of the Aaron Butler fan club, NoCal chapter. Hes been making all these shows and even a music video&amp;ndash;our friends would totally dig seeing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Morrowind&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So many games, so little time. :) Somehow I never got around to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/the-elder-scrolls-iii-morrowind&#34;&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, but Aaron and I chilled at his place for a bit after lunch and he regaled me with the charms of the game. It looked pretty good! It reminded me a little of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mobygames.com/game/dos/knights-of-legend&#34;&gt;Knights of Legend&lt;/a&gt;, for some reason. We played through a bit and it was pretty fun. I&amp;rsquo;ll go buy a copy off of Ebay later, but I keep thinking it&amp;rsquo;s so much more fun to share this stuff with friends than to play even a really good game alone. We talked a little of the days of yore when pen-and-paper RPGs forever changed our lives by opening up world of creativity and possibility. I suggested maybe we could get a game together while I&amp;rsquo;m down here, I mean, a lot of my high school gaming buddies still live in the area. Well see if we all can coordinate schedulesit sure gets harder after college! :p&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>LA Gamer Friends and My Reunion</title>
      <link>https://ggr.com/la-gamer-friends-and-my-reunion.html</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 16 Nov 2003 19:03:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ggr.com/la-gamer-friends-and-my-reunion.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last night I attended my high school reunion. I met up with my old friend Dean Musson beforehand and met his 3 month old daughter Mathilda, who is as cute as can be. All smile and naps. :) Hes a stay-at-home dad for a few months and he cant do too much&amp;hellip;everything is in 2 hour feed-sleep cycles. He and Amy are big gamers and hes tried to fit in some &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/pc/shadowbane/&#34;&gt;Shadowbane&lt;/a&gt;, but its hard to do much but clean the house and watch Jerry Springer. Babys cries dont wait for you to finish your big online battle. And theres no pause button either. :p&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hearing how Dean and Amy game together got me thinking about the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ggr.com/ea-qa-and-the-life.html&#34;&gt;social&lt;/a&gt; aspects of games again. I remember times when my brothers and I would play games like &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda_(video_game)&#34;&gt;Zelda&lt;/a&gt; and it was more fun to play together, taking turns steering the game, than to play alone. Even though one might expect that just watching would not be that fun, I&amp;rsquo;ve had a lot of single-player computer game experiences that were shared and that were a lot more fun for it! From Deans description MMPORPGs are especially well suited to playing with a significant other or roommate&amp;ndash;it reduces the learning curve, increases the social fun factor, and gives you an ally to start the game with. It would be cool if this sort of gameplay was actually promoted, though I could see the need to balance it carefully, lest lone gunmen feel excluded or too big an advantage accrues to in-room gamers vs. non (like you might find with &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-Strike&#34;&gt;Counter-Strike&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Lay Of the MMPORPG Land&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked Dean to give me a tour of Shadowbane and then I asked about the other MMPORPG hes tried. He used to be a big &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/pc/everquest/&#34;&gt;Evercrack&lt;/a&gt; user, he stopped because it was taking too much time to keep up with the complicated &amp;lsquo;office politics&amp;rsquo; that had emerged in the game. He was a leader of a guild and playing was basically a big chat dedicated to dealing with all the people he knew in the game. It was fun, but not really the sort of material anyone would turn into a novel. He and Amy had tried &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/pc/everquest/&#34;&gt;Ashernons Call&lt;/a&gt; before that and had played a month without interacting with anyone&amp;ndash;they figured that wasnt what they were looking for so they moved on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I told them about my short lived experience with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/ultima-online-third-dawn&#34;&gt;Ultima Online&lt;/a&gt;&amp;ndash;my low level fighter got his ass kicked by a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2003/11/12&#34;&gt;rabbit&lt;/a&gt; (they probably thought that would be funny after one too many watchings of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.metacritic.com/movie/monty-python-and-the-holy-grail&#34;&gt;Holy Grail&lt;/a&gt;Id probably think it was funny too if my character wasnt ignominiously bleeding to death on the ground) and no one wanted to talk in town, so I figured Id find other ways to spend my money and time. Ashernons Call wasnt too much better, though I wasnt killed by rabbits. I played for a week but I never really got sucked into the game&amp;hellip;just a bit too freeform for me. I have IM and I dont really care about chatting in-character for its own sake. I was hoping to enjoy an authentic roleplaying experience; alas, that isnt the strength of MMPORPGs today. I&amp;rsquo;ve also realized how frustrating it would be to play with people who much more discretionary time on their hands and whom therefore command much more powerful characters while I&amp;rsquo;m resigned to the role of an extra in an almost non-existent plot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dean tells me one of the things that got him into Shadowbane was how easily he leveled up and gained parity with much of the people in the game. He also filled me in on the interesting inter-state politics that have emerged in the game&amp;hellip;it sounds like Shadowbane has got an edge with the creation a plotless environment that is nevertheless fun to play in, even if you arent online &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the time. I might just give this one a shot. Oh, and Dean joined the chorus of people that tell me I really should give &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/warcraft-iii-reign-of-chaos&#34;&gt;Warcraft III&lt;/a&gt; another try. I wasnt all that into the little bit I played&amp;ndash;thought it looked like better graphics applied to a game that I had really liked, but that I had already played enough of to last me a little while. And I&amp;rsquo;m told to fear the coming of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_Warcraft&#34;&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt; by both Dean and my bro John. It might be good. ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And About That Reunion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go &lt;a href=&#34;http://glendalehigh.com/&#34;&gt;Nitros&lt;/a&gt;! Hmm. Or was it Dynamiters? Yah, so Dean, Amy, and I went to the reunion. Sat at a table, and realized that we had, in fact, been in a class of 650, there were about 90 people there, and out of our class of 650 we had only really spoken with 5-20 people on any sort of regular basis while we were in high school. The numbers werent going to go our way. Heh heh. Lots of barely familiar faces but I said hi to as many as I felt might remember me and it was sort cool. Basically everyone had gained 20 pounds and was doing something normal with their lives. :) We ate our &amp;ldquo;$75&amp;rdquo; dinner, said some hellos and goodbyes, then jetted to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.barsinister.net/&#34;&gt;Bar Sinister&lt;/a&gt; for some drinks and a chill evening.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So I got up at 6a this morning to take care of some stuff before flying down to LA. For one, I timed a bunch of eBay auctions poorly and I&amp;rsquo;m packing them now. It probably doesnt help that I stayed up late opening up Pass 2 in SSX3. I also sent some emails out to contacts at EALA. I dont know if the new studio has opened yet, I&amp;rsquo;m guessing it hasnt. Id like to see the old one while I&amp;rsquo;m down there and say hi to some guys I&amp;rsquo;ve talked to a bunch of times. Hopefully I&amp;rsquo;ll hear back from Erin about her friend down there and I just got a really nice email I was CCed on from Neil to the guys he suggested I meet. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,398866/&#34;&gt;Chris Plummer&lt;/a&gt; is in LA and hes the guy that got into &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_Systems&#34;&gt;Origin&lt;/a&gt; using the say hi to everyone you can approach kinda like me.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>In-person For EAP Scheduled</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I heard from Stephanie of EAP last night&amp;ndash;I&amp;rsquo;m scheduled to spend some face-to-face time with the EAP folks next week. I got a chance to meet John and Craig &lt;a href=&#34;https://ggr.com/a-fond-adieu.html&#34;&gt;briefly&lt;/a&gt;, but this is the real deal. I&amp;rsquo;m really looking forward to sitting down with them and some of the EAP team and getting a better feel for how EAP works! &lt;em&gt;And&lt;/em&gt; asking more questions from my unending font of questions about game production and the industry. Stephanie tells me an email with the official application and NDA will be in my box shortly. I dont want to get too excited yet, but its great to have made it that much closer!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Fond Adieu</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Before I took off I stopped by to say hi to &lt;a href=&#34;https://ggr.com/first-interview.html&#34;&gt;John Vifian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://ggr.com/on-the-phone-with-craig-alexander.html&#34;&gt;Craig Alexander&lt;/a&gt; to put a face with the name. I noticed that John had a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.logitech.com/en-us/support/286?crid=411&#34;&gt;wireless Logitech joystick&lt;/a&gt;&amp;ndash;I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about getting one. But he says it sucks. Except when you plug it into someone elses machine, program the fire button to emulate the keypress of &amp;rsquo;e&amp;rsquo; and then wait for your, uh, &amp;lsquo;friend&amp;rsquo; to fly a plane while playing Battlefield: 1942. So, if you know John, and youve been ejecting out of your plane a lot lately, look for strange dongles hanging off you computer. ;)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bond and Jordan Maynard</title>
      <link>https://ggr.com/bond-and-jordan-maynard.html</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2003 19:18:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ggr.com/bond-and-jordan-maynard.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;After &lt;a href=&#34;https://ggr.com/lunch-with-erin-turner.html&#34;&gt;lunch&lt;/a&gt; Erin and I walked over to say hi to &lt;a href=&#34;https://ggr.com/reinforcements.html&#34;&gt;Jordan Maynard&lt;/a&gt;. Erin took off for her appearance at Stanford and Jordan sat me down and showed me what he was working on. He helps with the animation on Bond&amp;ndash;he develops some of the custom tools they use and the capabilities are seriously ahead of the pack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as I can tell, hes working on the holy grail of character animation: hes building and tweaking a tool that allows a programmer to take a character and just tell him what to do from this inventory of moves&amp;ndash;and the character moves properly, transitions and all. The animators still have to build all the moves, but the intermediary states arent a problem anymore. On top of that, hes found a way to get the number of key states for the skeletons down dramatically by using this method&amp;ndash;for a substantial memory savings. Really brilliant stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jordan showed me some of the gameplay and it looks great. Bond can do all manner of badass stuff. I especially like how they handle aiming&amp;ndash;I&amp;rsquo;ve always found aiming on a console to be frustrating compared to using a mouse on a PC. Bond aims for you, but leaves you with enough control and other gaming elements that you dont miss it at all. I looks like it allows you to focus on doing badass Bond moves and enjoying the plot of the game instead. Sweet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still cant quite get over what a great vibe I get from everybody I&amp;rsquo;m meeting. Jordan is cool. Erin is cool. Neil is cool. I mean, not only are they talented, theyre the kind of people I would totally hangout with &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the kind I would like to work with (up to this point, I haven&amp;rsquo;t been able to say &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; about too many people). I dont know if I&amp;rsquo;m just getting really lucky with the people I&amp;rsquo;m meeting so far or what, but its quite a pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I took off Jordan showed me the EA manifesto from the mid-80s (or around then). I&amp;rsquo;m going to ask him to email me a copy, it looks really cool. It asks if a computer can make you cry&amp;ndash;I think it means in a good way. ;) And I think thats the right question.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lunch With Erin Turner</title>
      <link>https://ggr.com/lunch-with-erin-turner.html</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2003 17:14:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ggr.com/lunch-with-erin-turner.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;After I said &lt;a href=&#34;https://ggr.com/sit-down-with-neil-young.html&#34;&gt;goodbye&lt;/a&gt; to Neil I headed to the lobby of 250. I was a little early so I played some &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox/ssx-3&#34;&gt;SSX 3&lt;/a&gt; while I waited for &lt;a href=&#34;https://ggr.com/reinforcements.html&#34;&gt;Erin&lt;/a&gt;. Once she appeared I pried myself off the console and we headed to lunch at the EA cafeteria. My first time there&amp;hellip;man if the cafeterias had been like this at Berkeley. The food was entirely, you know, identifiable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I told her about my meeting with Neil as I wondered what it all meant. She assured me that its all good and that Neil is an ideal guy for me to know at EA. With that we got to talking about the challenges with growing the industry, especially marketing games to females. I brought up a recent lecture by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tompeters.com/&#34;&gt;Tom Peters&lt;/a&gt; where he talks about marketing to women and points out what seems to me a good solution: we need more game companies with boards, EPs, programmers and organizations that look more like the market we want to go after (i.e. more women wherever there arent that many right now). Heh heh, she had heard the broadcast too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erin and I headed over to her office after lunch and she showed me the latest trailer for Bond. Apparently the one in the lobby of 250 is an old version. The new one she showed me rocked&amp;hellip;I&amp;rsquo;m going to have trouble waiting until February. She walked me over to say hi to Jordan before she headed off to give a lecture at Stanford; Bond trailer in hand. Thats just too cool in my book. :) I hope I get a chance to work with her on a game someday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before she took off she mentioned she may have someone I should meet while I&amp;rsquo;m in LA next week. She invited me to the Two Towers (extended version) at EA but I think I might have to miss it, unfortunately I dont think I will be in town. I hear the extra 40 minutes they added back are all the character and plot development that were missing from the theatrical release. It would have been fun to meet more people there too. I&amp;rsquo;ll just have to make up for it in LA.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sit Down With Neil Young</title>
      <link>https://ggr.com/sit-down-with-neil-young.html</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2003 16:43:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ggr.com/sit-down-with-neil-young.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When Neil &lt;a href=&#34;https://ggr.com/an-email-from-neil-young.html&#34;&gt;offered&lt;/a&gt; to meet with me last week it was sort of like I had written a blog about how I like epic movies and then I got an email from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001392/&#34;&gt;Peter Jackson&lt;/a&gt; offering to meet with me. Basically, it was really cool :) So I was looking forward to meeting Neil and seeing what it was we would talk about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who Are You, Who Are Any Of Us?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was no open position we were meeting to talk about&amp;ndash;I was just looking for advice and I was excited to be talking to someone who really knows his stuff. Neil opened by saying he dug my blog and appreciated my interest in EA and thats why he offered to meet me. And then he hit me with the threes (of death): what are your three all-time favorite: games, books, songs, movies? Heres how I recall answering:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;games: Half-Life, Pacman, System Shock 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;books: LOTR, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0316346624/qid=1068684670/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/104-7998853-1870303?v=glance&amp;amp;n=507846&#34;&gt;The Tipping Point&lt;/a&gt;, Managing Brand Equity (I was feeling a bit like a business dork as I realized most of the books I read these days are biz books)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;songs: Bachs Passacaglia in C minor, Hows It Going To Be by Third Eye Blind, and a jazz song I couldnt recall at the time (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00008G997/qid=1068684733/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/104-7998853-1870303?v=glance&amp;amp;s=music&amp;amp;n=507846&#34;&gt;Where Breathing Starts&lt;/a&gt; by Tord Gustavsen)
movies: Amelie, Casablanca, The Matrix&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope I did ok on the personality test. At least it wasnt the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.myersbriggs.org/&#34;&gt;Myers-Briggs&lt;/a&gt;. ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Neil Got Here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked about how he got his start in the industry&amp;ndash;hes been a coder his whole life starting with the &lt;a href=&#34;http://oldcomputers.net/atari400.html&#34;&gt;Atari 400&lt;/a&gt; (I started on the Atari 800, but he was way more advanced than I). He got into production after shipping a couple games and hes been there ever since. He quit college early to pursue his true calling, it looks to me like he made the right choice. He had asked me earlier whether I had a Masters degree and then why not? I said I havent had a reason to get one. Heh. One of these days I really have to ask Neil what hes trying to get a sense of with these questions. I couldnt read much from his poker face. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some Industry Talk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What distinguishes an outstanding producer from an ok one?&amp;rdquo; I asked. I want to become an outstanding producer, I explained, and I&amp;rsquo;m trying to figure out not only a way to get started in the industry, not just a path to becoming a producer, but a path to becoming a really good producer. I&amp;rsquo;m trying to figure out what I need to learn and how I can learn it. Neil told me that I will have to discover whether I&amp;rsquo;m a natural for production&amp;ndash;not everyone can be Michael Jordan regardless of how hard they try, but if I happen to have the right personality and I build up the experience I need, here are the attributes that would complete the package:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;clarity of vision&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ability to communicate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;unending energy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;good design skills and a recognition that they arent great skills&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;solid grasp of the technology so you can advocate for innovations effectively, when its appropriate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;always see room for improvement in my work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;be the kind of person that inspires hard work &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; loyalty&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked him about why Purple Moon didnt work out and why Homeworld didnt do well (it was interesting to hear how his take on it was &lt;a href=&#34;https://ggr.com/on-the-phone-with-craig-alexander.html&#34;&gt;similar&lt;/a&gt; to Craig Alexanders, yet they explained it in a different way). Then we talked about what its like to work at EA, and how the Producer and the DD are different. We talked about a whole lot more and I got a lot out of it. I could have gone on asking questions for hours but I didnt want to monopolize Neils time. Well I do, but it wouldnt be nice. :) Id love the chance to ask him more stuff&amp;hellip;I can tell that he has a lot of the answers I havent been able to find in books and articles on the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thats All Folks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got the impression that Neil shares a similar love of mixing games, technology, and business as I do. When he was telling me about how he loves a strong story line, good sound that supports a sense of immersion, and good characters I kept thinking that he took the words right out of my mouth. And then hes telling me about how he likes to make money by making games, I thought again, &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m really looking forward to working with a company that has people like Neil at the helm&amp;ndash;I&amp;rsquo;m going to make sure to stay in touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Towards the end of our conversation I ask who else Neil thought I should try to meet at EA and he suggested David De Martini, Bing Gordon (the CCO and a cofounder), and Chris Plumber (who beat down the door to get into Origin and whom exemplifies the producer with unending energy). I&amp;rsquo;ll be in LA next week and Chris works down there&amp;ndash;I&amp;rsquo;ll get in touch with him first. And hopefully the others soon!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On the schedule for today was a meeting with Neil Young, lunch with Erin Turner, and quick hellos with Jordan Maynard and John Vifian. I was hoping to get in touch with Rob Moreno and [Tara S.][1] as well, but I&amp;rsquo;ll have to catch them next time. I just got back and I&amp;rsquo;ve been smiling like a goofball most of the day. It was a lot of fun talking with everyone and I really dig the vibe I get when I&amp;rsquo;m at EA. But you knew that. ;) Low down on each of these meetings to follow shortly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated on June 8th, 2015&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Removed link to Tara and abbreviated her name at her request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Switched link to Tara from her personal site (which has nothing on it these days) to her LinkedIn profile.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>An Email From Neil Young</title>

      <guid>https://ggr.com/an-email-from-neil-young.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Thursday I got an email, out of the blue, from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId=1770/&#34;&gt;Neil Young&lt;/a&gt;. Hes a very experienced Executive Producer at EA, judging from his rap sheet. He said he saw this web site and he offered to meet with me. I called his assistant and we set a time to meet this coming Wednesday. Totally made my day. :) I&amp;rsquo;m going to get in touch with Erin Turner, Jordan Maynard, and John Vifian and see if theyll be around so I can stop by and say hi while I&amp;rsquo;m at EARS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>On the Phone With Craig Alexander</title>
      <link>https://ggr.com/on-the-phone-with-craig-alexander.html</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2003 16:58:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ggr.com/on-the-phone-with-craig-alexander.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just got back from the gym when I noticed Craig Alexander had left a message. John had &lt;a href=&#34;https://ggr.com/first-interview.html&#34;&gt;told me&lt;/a&gt; he was the next person I would talk to at EAP, but I didnt know when I would hear from him. I guess today. :) I just missed him by about 15 minutes so I called back and we started things off with me offering a little background on myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell Me a Little About Yourself&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I like making things,&amp;rdquo; is my lead in to tell about how I started programming sometime around 8 years old, I played with Legos, I rewired the electrical in my house, and I&amp;rsquo;ve helped start 3 companies to date. Craig then tells me about what EAP does, how studio production is different (EAP often gets to see new IP first, for one), and how production might be a better fit for my interests than the DD role, since I want to expand my emphasis on the creative side of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He asked what genre I like best and my answer was RPG, with the caveat that what I really love is immersion, a rich story world, a compelling plot, and characters that I care about. While RPG is the genre where these attributes tend to be emphasized, I&amp;rsquo;ve found immersive games in FPS (System Shock 2, Half-Life, Alice), RTS (Homeworld), and other genreI really am more interested in immersion as a design goal than what genre it&amp;rsquo;s applied to. Then he asked about what I&amp;rsquo;m playing now, and which games I&amp;rsquo;ve finished recently. I&amp;rsquo;m playing SSX3, Fatal Frame, and Vice City. I recently finished Homeworld 2 and Alice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So You Said You Like Homeworld&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Craig told me that Homeworld didnt sell well, and he asked me why I think that might be the case. Uh&amp;hellip;I thought it sold well, it got good reviews, I thought to myself. Hmm. I took a stab and said that there was a bit of a barrier to learning the game, it requires a time investment, so maybe it appealed to the enthusiast more than the mainstream player. And maybe it didnt have the right mix of marketing and promotion? I got the official answer from him later in the conversation: interface was too complicated for the mass market and the sci-fi epic is on a down-cycle. I think he cheated though; he actually has the PC Data reports. ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We talked a bunch more&amp;ndash;Craig kept me on my toes! I asked him a bunch of question about the industry and he had some really great, informative answers. I can tell I would learn a &lt;em&gt;ton&lt;/em&gt; by working with him. He said that he appreciated my enthusiasm for the industry and EA specifically and that he felt I should meet some people on his team in person soon and see how we got along. Yes! I&amp;rsquo;ve landed my first official in-person interview at EA. :)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Nonsequiter Project</title>
      <link>https://ggr.com/nonsequiter-project.html</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 08 Nov 2003 01:05:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ggr.com/nonsequiter-project.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I met up with my friend Ben Durbin at Buzz9 about in the middle of the evenings festivities after the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ggr.com/first-igda-chapter-meeting-soon.html&#34;&gt;IGDA meeting&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday. I only managed a single &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.guinness.com/&#34;&gt;Guinness&lt;/a&gt; on the IGDA tab before we were talking shop. As you may recall, &lt;a href=&#34;https://ggr.com/find-your-bliss.html&#34;&gt;Nonsequiter&lt;/a&gt; is a small group of game newbies that has been getting together with the intention of sharing our experiences in the game biz, and more importantly, to make some games. The conversation turned towards &lt;a href=&#34;https://ggr.com/system-shock-3.html&#34;&gt;SS3&lt;/a&gt; for a little while, but were now of the opinion that we should start smaller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ben suggested that we just start by becoming familiar with the basic technologies in DirectX and see whats easy to build. Then, we can take inventory of our paint brushes and canvas, if you will, so we know what is available to us out-of-the-box and what we would have to spend more time to build. I think we were both of a mind to focus more on innovative gameplay ideas rather than innovative visual effects, so well be spending more time on game design, trying to stay within the sweet spot for easy development on the engine we choose. Sorta like what Jordan &lt;a href=&#34;https://ggr.com/reinforcements.html&#34;&gt;does&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I rambled on a bit towards the endabout the potential for games to transcend entertainment and eventually become art like some films have. Or to educate at least as effectively, if not more effectively than film or TV even when the point of the game is to be fun (so the player learns on accident). There was even a bit about how MMPORPGs are going to have to evolve their own, unique gameplay rather than trying to strap pen-and-paper onto a technology medium that has radically different strengths (yet to really be discovered). And I only had one beer! :) With that, it was time to dodge between raindrops for a few blocks, hop on the BART, and get ready to do some serious blogging in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>BAAD and Games At Work</title>
      <link>https://ggr.com/baad-and-games-at-work.html</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 07 Nov 2003 15:30:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ggr.com/baad-and-games-at-work.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just came across an article about how &lt;a href=&#34;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/3247595.stm&#34;&gt;games&lt;/a&gt; may improve productivity at work. It reminded me of my consulting team at QuickStart. I dubbed my team BAAD (Bay Area Applications Development) and games were allowed in the office. Heck, half the time &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; was on &lt;a href=&#34;http://counterstrike.wikia.com/wiki/AWP&#34;&gt;AWP&lt;/a&gt; duty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My team handled the applications development for QuickStarts consulting practice in Northern California and I was blessed with a team of outstanding consultants. Not only could they program&amp;ndash;they were communicators who worked well with our customers. While our job was about non-game as you get (writing accounting software, project management software, and walking clients through needs analysis) the office gameplay was a tremendous boon to team cohesiveness and morale. We all &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; talk about how much fun it was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think there is something that needs to be said for treating people like human beings instead of &amp;lsquo;resources.&amp;rsquo; I see so many companies these days that monitor their employees email, filter out &lt;a href=&#34;http://web.archive.org/web/20040219150927/http://www.cnn.com/2003/TECH/internet/11/07/web.surfing.ap/index.html&#34;&gt;websites&lt;/a&gt; like Hotmail, and otherwise treat their employees with distrust. I cant help but think how counterproductive it is. What kind of work environment does that create?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can tell you from first hand experience that the easiest path to a motivated team is to provide a positive environment that treats each of them as an individual who is worthy of respect and the support of the larger company community. If youve got their back, they will have yours, its that simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article also reminds me of how we are stuck in the mentality that hours in the office = productivity. Its a common fallacy in most industries&amp;ndash;manager that manage by visibility in the office rather than actual output. Its certainly easier to just assume that if someone is there from 9-6 that they are getting more done than someone who is there from 9-4, but that management strategy has a lot of limitations (and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t tend to be very accurate&amp;ndash;one person can have a much different hourly output than another). I&amp;rsquo;ve managed distributed teams of developers where managing by hours was not an option. Instead, I had to understand the tasks and the people so I could measure their performance against milestones rather than &amp;lsquo;hours spent.&amp;rsquo; The upshot of all this was they got incredible flexibility (want to take Tuesday off?&amp;hellip;ok, just as long as the task is done on time) and if they were more efficient that the average guy, we both got the benefit&amp;ndash;it was done sooner and they had some free time to spend however they wanted. I admit its one of the hardest ways to manage people, until you get your data driven process down. Then in becomes one of the most pleasant ways to manage that I&amp;rsquo;ve ever come across.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I expect I wont get a chance to try anything like this out in the game industry for the first couple years, but I&amp;rsquo;m very curious to see how management styles work in the game industry vs. the several models I&amp;rsquo;ve seen in biz software.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At Wednesdays IGDA meeting I met a few cool people that I&amp;rsquo;m hoping I&amp;rsquo;ll get a chance to stay in touch with. I usually like to follow up with an email within 24 hours, but I&amp;rsquo;m pushing about 26 here. ;) Dave Rohrl was an outstanding speaker and he seemed to me the bottomless pit of game industry wisdom and friendly wit. Liz Wakefield made the whole thing happen and seems like shed be cool to just hang with. I didnt get a chance to speak much with Jennifer Olsen, but Id love to learn more about what its like to be Editor-in-Chief for &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; game magazine. And Bill Swartz was a straight to the point, no bullshit, really good insights into production kinda guy. Totally been there, done that and now hes at his own studio. I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to seeing some of them at the next event if we dont have the chance to speak sooner.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>IGDA SF Meeting</title>
      <link>https://ggr.com/igda-sf-meeting.html</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 06 Nov 2003 23:12:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ggr.com/igda-sf-meeting.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I attended my first IGDA SF meeting last night at the Art Institute (I have a friend that works there too). The meeting centered on a discussion of the newly released whitepaper by the &lt;a href=&#34;http://wiki.igda.org/Online_Games_SIG/Steering_Committee&#34;&gt;Online Games Committee&lt;/a&gt;. John Welch of &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shockwave.com&#34;&gt;Shockwave.com&lt;/a&gt;, Dave Rohrl of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pogo.com&#34;&gt;EA Online&lt;/a&gt;, Margaret Wallace of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.skunkstudios.com/&#34;&gt;Skunk Studios&lt;/a&gt;, and Mark DeLoura of Sony formed the evenings panel with Jennifer Olsen (editor-in-chief of &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Developer_Magazine&#34;&gt;Game Developer Magazine&lt;/a&gt;) moderating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was very impressed by Dave, who I felt did an excellent job of presenting his perspective on online gaming and he was just a fun speaker. I finally met Liz Wakefield in person (after a few emails back and forth)&amp;ndash;she chairs the chapter and serves as the operations manager for the IGDA. I spoke to her at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.yelp.com/biz/buzz-9-cafe-san-francisco&#34;&gt;Buzz9&lt;/a&gt; afterwards and learned that she majored in English and sorta fell into the role through her job at CMP. But shes still a big gamer. :) She was there with Susan from the GDC&amp;ndash;shes got her hands full preparing for GDC 2004 these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had this great discussion with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,4031/&#34;&gt;Bill Swartz&lt;/a&gt;, Simon (the audio guy&amp;hellip;didnt catch his last name), and a couple others. We talked about what makes a good or a bad producer. Opinions differed by role (some people who havent worn the hat think a good one is hands off, for example), but Bill seemed to win everyone over with the idea that a good producer lays down the law when he needs to, is a strong leader, but gets out of the way when things are on track. Sounds like overlap between biz production and game production to me. :) Bill also made some good points on why EA is cool, and LucasArt (of which I&amp;rsquo;m a fan) has really not capitalized well on its opportunities. Once again I seem to have no problem bumping into EA fans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I havent told you much about the presentation yet, I&amp;rsquo;m already at the beer part of the evening. I&amp;rsquo;ll leave you with some tidbits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;60 minutes of game play seems to be the maximum it should take to entice a player to upgrade to a paying, enhanced version of the game&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But a web or downloaded game must be fun within the first 60 seconds of play because the player is not very invested (i.e. he didnt pay $50) and is unlikely to spend a lot of time trying to find the fun&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sony has shipped 1 million online adapters for the PS/2, but its a cost-center right now. They havent tried to make money on it yet, its a blind investment&amp;ndash;they are laying foundation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It costs between $50k and $150k to make your average web or downloadable (non-CD) game, so it affords greater experimentation. The budget is in some cases a reflection of bandwidth constraints on the size of the game&amp;ndash;it just doesnt make sense to spend $2m on a 2mb game.
The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.garagegames.com/products/torque-3d&#34;&gt;Torque&lt;/a&gt; engine is an up-and-comer. Its being sold for $100 by some rich dude who wants to give indies a better chance and hes got the money to sell this $50k tool for $100. It was the only game engine anyone mentioned without rolling their eyes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m told I will be bumping into &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ignitedusa.com/&#34;&gt;IgnitedMinds&lt;/a&gt; a lot for some reason. Hmm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Conversation With Tiffany</title>
      <link>https://ggr.com/conversation-with-tiffany.html</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 06 Nov 2003 11:13:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ggr.com/conversation-with-tiffany.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just spoke with Tiffany Spencer of Ubisoft. She manages the PR for the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/tom-clancys-splinter-cell&#34;&gt;Clancy series&lt;/a&gt; for Ubisoft&amp;hellip;I&amp;rsquo;ve been &lt;a href=&#34;https://ggr.com/phone-tag-and-persistence.html&#34;&gt;trying&lt;/a&gt; to get a hold of her for a little while. She was out of town on business and vacation, so that explains it. Pretty cool stuff though; she just had a meeting with MTV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tiffany noted that the Ubisoft office in SF is in fact a marketing office; though it is also home to a number of Ubisoft producers who manage relationships with their local studio partners (sorta like the role at EAP I&amp;rsquo;m interviewing for). MS, Nintendo, Sony, Activision, and Ubisoft are all important players she says, though she thinks they are a little bureaucratic (as they have to be since they are so large). Sierra and Maxis are smaller and better for starting out she thinks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tiffany worked with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wired.com/techbiz/media/news/1997/04/2958&#34;&gt;Mplayer&lt;/a&gt; for a while (remember that?). Heh heh. Blast to the past! Guess it wasnt that long ago they were presenting at E3 as the next cool thing. She doesnt know too many people in production she said, but she offered to introduce me to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId=11359/&#34;&gt;Sean Decker&lt;/a&gt;, a friend of hers that works on the SimCity team. That would be excellent, especially considering the informational interview I have with Maxis in December.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>First Interview</title>
      <link>https://ggr.com/first-interview.html</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2003 22:10:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ggr.com/first-interview.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had my first interview with EA today. John Vifian gave me a call at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ggr.com/and-on-the-eap-front.html&#34;&gt;appointed time&lt;/a&gt; and we talked about the job of Development Director (DD) at EA Partners (EAP). It was fun talking to him&amp;ndash;he has some great experience in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Development Director&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DDs report to Exec Producers who report to Tom Frisina. As I understand it, DDs at EAP represent the publishers (EA&amp;rsquo;s) interests on a project by helping guide the studio EA has a partnership with; ideally to help them take a successful game and turn it into a successful franchise. That involves the omnipresent budget, schedule, and product/quality &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/1556159005/ref=sib_vae_pg_4/104-7998853-1870303?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;amp;keywords=triangle&amp;amp;p=S045&amp;amp;twc=8&amp;amp;checkSum=liEp6n4LqpAGxqgPYRnlD61L72TBrBNPnW1T5JKzZmo%3D#reader-link&#34;&gt;balancing act&lt;/a&gt; for which the DD is ultimately responsible. It sounds a lot like a publisher-side Producer role as I&amp;rsquo;ve seen them at other publishers. The DD at Maxis is a bit heavier on the technical side of things and is internal to the studio, so EAPs DD seems a little different. I think I recall John mentioning that the role is somewhat new for EAP, but I&amp;rsquo;m not certain if I remember that correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also spoke about my reasons for wanting to work in game production and whether EAP would be a better fit than a production role on a game. Frankly, they &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; sound like a lot of fun to me! On the one hand, I love driving business and working with partner organizations to get things done. What EAP does is a lot of what has drawn me to consulting over and over, but with the added bonus of working on &lt;em&gt;games&lt;/em&gt; as the product. On the other hand, I also love being on the ground, helping shape a piece of software into a full fledged product, which is more the role of a studio producer. I think I cannot go wrong applying for production jobs in EAP or elsewhere in EA. :) I tend to lean slightly toward EAP-style production over studio-production, but theyd both be a great time in my book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking For 3-5 Years Of Game Production Experience&amp;hellip;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We interwove a discussion of my background while we spoke about the DD role in general&amp;ndash;we seemed to arrive at a consensus that I&amp;rsquo;m a fit for DD in every way except for my limited game production experience, so were thinking of ways to ramp me quickly in that respect. After I got off the call I thought about the ways I&amp;rsquo;ve been working to get up to speed on game development so far and I came up with a few things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve befriended a number of producers, 2 developer CEOs, and a number of other industry veterans whom I speak with regularly in order to gain a better understanding of game production. I&amp;rsquo;ve also joined the IGDA&amp;rsquo;s committee on Quality of Life and I&amp;rsquo;m contributing to a whitepaper and a panel at the next GDC. In that capacity I&amp;rsquo;ve begun interviewing producers, developers, testers, and artists about their experiences&amp;hellip;it&amp;rsquo;s been an invaluable learning experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have read most of the production articles on Gamasutra and I plan on rereading them before my first day of work. I&amp;rsquo;ve also started on the postmortems. Between these two sections I&amp;rsquo;ve found some helpful insights into the issues specific to game production. I&amp;rsquo;ve found a lot of parallels where my experience will apply well and I&amp;rsquo;ve had the chance to identify a number of areas I want to learn more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other books on my reading list before day 1 of work are: &lt;em&gt;Game Design: Theory &amp;amp; Practice&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Game Architecture and Design&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Masters of Doom&lt;/em&gt;. Besides being a quick learner (I love learning, it&amp;rsquo;s one of my hobbies), I happen to be a very good book learner and these books have been praised for their insights into game development.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve spent the last several months becoming familiar with the game industry itself&amp;ndash;how it works, who the players are, where the money is, and where the tea leaves appear to be pointing. I feel I have a solid beginning grasp of the business which I expect will help me understand what my boss and my boss&amp;rsquo;s boss are trying to accomplish.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being a lifelong gamer, it&amp;rsquo;s no big sacrifice to buy and play a few more of the latest games. ;) Lately I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing The Sims, SimCity 4, Battlefield: 1942, Homeworld 2, Fatal Frame, Battle Realms, Jedi Outcast, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, and American McGee&amp;rsquo;s Alice not only for my personal enjoyment, but also with a critical eye towards how they are built, why they are or are not fun, and what their target market is. I&amp;rsquo;ve started a notebook where I record the high points and low point of each so I can apply what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned to future projects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coming Up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It does sound a bit salesie unfortunately, but I wanted to follow up promptly so I just did the brain dump&amp;ndash;I emailed these to John shortly after our call. I&amp;rsquo;ve thought of a number of ways that I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to work on it once I&amp;rsquo;m on board, but I&amp;rsquo;ll save that for my next interview. John tells me the next step is to setup a call with the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId=5637/&#34;&gt;Craig Alexander&lt;/a&gt;, the hiring manager. Craig sounds like a very busy guy though, and I didnt get the impression they are trying to fill the spot to meet a deadline, so I&amp;rsquo;m guessing I&amp;rsquo;ll hear from him sometime in the next few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just got off the phone with Lisa Bell. The scoop is that they already have someone internal for the position&amp;ndash;the post to EA jobs was really more of a formality. But, even though they dont have other production positions open, Lisa said she liked my resume and would like to speak to me in December. Were scheduled for a phone call 1st week of December. Pretty cool. Glad I made that phone call. :)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Went back and forth via email yesterday with John Vifian of EA Partners. RJ said he thinks they used to be called EA Distribution, at least when he was there. RJ worked with John briefly and had a good impression. Johns a Director of Development. I believe he works for Tom Frisina&amp;hellip;I think Rob mentioned that Tom heads up the team. John is interested in interviewing me by phone Wednesday. I&amp;rsquo;m very excited! I gotta work on my interview skills though, I havent had to interview in a while. :p I&amp;rsquo;m skimming a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/156414464X/qid=1067979290/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/104-7998853-1870303?v=glance&amp;amp;n=507846&#34;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; on interviewing today to refresh my memory and prompt me to think about the basic kinds questions I&amp;rsquo;m likely to be asked. Actually, its given me some good ideas for resume improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So I emailed Kana Ryan and she forwarded me with a nice intro to Lisa Bell. I was getting all excited that I had a good intro into the hiring manager until I emailed Toby and he told me Lisa is in HR (and therefore a gatekeeper). I did think it a bit odd that the only credit I could find for her was a &amp;ldquo;thank you&amp;rdquo; on the Sims Online. Heh. Hopefully shell realize what a catch I am ;)I&amp;rsquo;ll see if I can convince her by giving her a phone call or two. I&amp;rsquo;m wondering if I should just take a stab at who the hiring manager might be and email some of the producers on the credits for the other SimCity games&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dinner With the QS Gang</title>
      <link>https://ggr.com/dinner-with-the-qs-gang.html</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2003 22:17:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ggr.com/dinner-with-the-qs-gang.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just got back from dinner with some friends from my days at QuickStart, one of which is was Matthew Chamberlain of Microsoft. He reports that hes still on the hunt at MS on my behalf (which is, of course, awfully nice of him). We got together a couple weeks ago at the MS SF office to search for people to talk to. We decided it would be a good idea to start with a couple of guys at the top (it goes something like: guys at the top-&amp;gt;studio heads-&amp;gt;exec producers-&amp;gt;producers-&amp;gt;associate producers) and go from there. He tells me hes helping because he cares about his MS stock price. Indeed. Heh heh. He also reminded me that he can hook me up with any &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mobygames.com/company/microsoft-studios&#34;&gt;MS published&lt;/a&gt; games at a big discount. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joel Naumoff is another friend of mine from our QS days who was at dinner. We got to talking about games (as I&amp;rsquo;m prone to do at times). He hasnt played anything since Civ2, which he liked a lot. RTSes are too fast paced and click-fest oriented for his tastes, and he never latched onto FPS. It was interesting to talk to one more person who used to play games a lot but doesnt anymore. We came up with a few ideas on why he doesnt play:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Too much time required to play the games&amp;ndash;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/civilization-ii&#34;&gt;Civilization 2&lt;/a&gt; is fun, but you have to commit 10+ hours for a good game of it. I wonder if console games do better relative to PC games for the 30+ crowd because of this. Most console games are easy and fun to pickup and play whenever you have a few minutes. Another reason &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tetris.com/&#34;&gt;Tetris&lt;/a&gt; is popular, I think.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Too high a time barrier to learn a new game&amp;ndash;&lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.counter-strike.net/&#34;&gt;Stars&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/homeworld&#34;&gt;Homeworld&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/system-shock-2&#34;&gt;System Shock 2&lt;/a&gt; are examples of tutorials done right. I especially like the way &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox/fatal-frame&#34;&gt;Fatal Frame&lt;/a&gt; integrates their tutorials into the gameplay itself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not very social&amp;ndash;gaming is in many ways an antisocial activity&amp;hellip;Matt&amp;rsquo;s wife complains when he spends too much time playing games rather than participating like one would with a game of cards or Scrabble.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good stuff to think about. Sorta fishtails with a lot of my personal ponderings on why some games are fun and have staying power while others do not. GGA &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gamegirladvance.com/2003/11/the-wsj-gets-it.html&#34;&gt;talks about&lt;/a&gt; this excellent WSJ article that makes some great points along the same lines. We are just on the tip of this cultural icebergall the possibilities are in front of us.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My friend Auren emailed me an introduction to Tiffany Spencer who is a PR Manager (as best I can tellshe works out of SF and Ubisofts SF office is a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ubisoftgroup.com/en-US/about_ubisoft/world_presence/biz_northamerica.aspx&#34;&gt;marketing office&lt;/a&gt;) for &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubisoft&#34;&gt;Ubisoft&lt;/a&gt;. She emailed me once last week but I havent been able to reach her since. Perhaps shes out of town or very busy. I am reminded of how many times I have had to contact a person 10 times or more before I finally got a hold of them. And most times it totally paid off. The reasons why people take a while can be all over the map, it pays not to take it personally and just realize that there are probably some perfectly good reasonsand in any case, it&amp;rsquo;s usually worth the wait.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>EA 10-K</title>
      <link>https://ggr.com/ea-10-k.html</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2003 23:16:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ggr.com/ea-10-k.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Its amazing what you can learn from reading the SEC filings for public companies. I thought Id check out EA&amp;rsquo;s filing in June and see what I could learn about the company. Its always a great way to see where the money really is and where the company is headed, generally speaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far I&amp;rsquo;ve gleaned a few interesting tidbits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The new EALA is going to be pretty important. EA is consolidating the old LA, Irvine, and Vegas studios into it, at substantial expense.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Publishing and distribution of 3rd party games has doubled in the last year, making it an important growth area for EA.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PS/2 revenues went down quite a bit in the last year, while PC went up slightly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EA still makes most of its money from PS/2 but PC is a solid second.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The US went up a healthy amount last year, but Europe was pretty flat. The US and Europe are the big markets for EA. Asia is small, but the combined total for the rest of the world as a whole is not to shabby.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EA loaned $4m to its EVP when they hired him last year. Awfully good sport of them. ;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>The Ancient Art of Resume Writing</title>
      <link>https://ggr.com/the-ancient-art-of-resume-writing.html</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2003 11:28:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ggr.com/the-ancient-art-of-resume-writing.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll be the first to admit that I find writing my own resume a challenge. On the one hand, I&amp;rsquo;m a fairly confident guy, but on the other hand, I dont really like tooting my own horn. Cant be too bold or too humble and I&amp;rsquo;ve gotta speak the right language. There are certain things I need to communicate to get past the gatekeepers and make it all the way to the hiring manager and &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; land an interview. Quite a skill unto itself&amp;hellip;its a lot to build into a sheet of paper. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first round of cuts often turns on key words. It just takes too long to get 1,000 resumes down to 50 by hand. If you have the key words you are in, if not, you are out. The next round is often done by a recruiter who has some key skills and experiences they are looking for. Finally you make it to the hiring manager who performs the most nuanced read with biases towards their exact situation. For each position I&amp;rsquo;m interested in, I try to get as much information about the criteria for each round so I can adapt my presentation to their requirements. But, there is a very short time window to do the research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Big Challenge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My greatest resume challenge when it comes to the game industry is that I do not yet have a credit to my name and theres no amount of resume rewriting that will change that! Most positions (even a lot of tester positions) ask for a number of years of experience working in the industry. Yes, its a bit of a catch 22, but that just means I&amp;rsquo;ve gotta be creative. I have to put more of an emphasis on the other ways of earning the interest of someone hiring associate producers&amp;ndash;like meeting them in person, the endorsement of someone they respect, game related projects that demonstrate my skill, and a cover letter that grabs their attention. Maybe even a web site and an email address that states my purpose. ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, there was a lot I could do to get my resume in a format that would be more familiar. Like using the vocabulary of the industry: production in place of application, for example. To give you an idea, here are the &lt;a href=&#34;http://s3.amazonaws.com/ggr_com/Scott%20Bonds&#39;%20resume%202003-05-20.pdf&#34;&gt;before&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://s3.amazonaws.com/ggr_com/Scott%20Bonds&#39;%20resume%202003-09-22.pdf&#34;&gt;after&lt;/a&gt; versions of my resume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But How Do I know If Its Good?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since companies rarely give out feedback about where in the process I&amp;rsquo;m getting cut, its hard to get a read on how well suited to its purpose my resume is. Ditto on the cover letter. Or rather, its hard to tell what is attributable to missing required skills vs. what is due to overall presentation. It is at least in part because of this that I&amp;rsquo;ve opted to spend more time working on ways to meet people&amp;ndash;I can generally get a read on how well I&amp;rsquo;m doing and thereby continually improve. Besides, personal connections are always more effective on both sides. People like to hire people who are a fit for their team and can do a good job, things that are not always discernible from a piece of paper&amp;ndash;in fact, they almost never are. Thats why there are interviews and references.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll keep looking for ways to make my resume better. RJ and Andy have helped me get it into an at least ok shape and well see what further feedback I can find. Its over here if you want some ideas for your own resume. I also recommend you check out &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0735713073/qid=1067455987/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/102-8710864-0356966?v=glance&amp;amp;n=507846&#34;&gt;Get in the Game&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; for more ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated on October 5th, 2013&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fixed the links to my old resumes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Maxis Assistant Producer II</title>

      <pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2003 10:12:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ggr.com/maxis-assistant-producer-ii.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just got the email that Maxis posted for an assistant producer on the SimCity series. Wow, that would be excellent&amp;hellip;Id love to have a chance to work at Maxis (which is, btw, an EA company). I sent an email over to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,8354/&#34;&gt;Kana Ryan&lt;/a&gt; whom I noticed was the exec producer on the SimCity series as of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mobygames.com/game/sheet/gameId,7999/&#34;&gt;SimCity 4&lt;/a&gt;. Yah, shes probably not the hiring manager, but hopefully shell be nice enough to forward it to them&amp;hellip;I also sent an email to &lt;a href=&#34;https://ggr.com/the-maxis-tour.html&#34;&gt;Toby&lt;/a&gt; asking if he might know who over there is the hiring manager so I can address my interest to the right person. I feel its better to address a letter to a specific person rather than a generic one, wherever possible. I&amp;rsquo;ll also submit my resume for the position through the EA jobs web site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just ordered a copy of SimCity 4. Figure I&amp;rsquo;ll have time to play through it before an interview would happen. Havent played the city series much since 2000 (what can I say, I got distracted by the whole starting new companies thing). I loved the SimCity Network Edition idea. I even liked SimEarth ;). I wonder where I put that&amp;hellip; Yup, my latest Sim is The Sims, which is pretty cool. I got see some of the new stuff Maxis is working on when I visited over there. My lips are sealed by NDA, but it looked freakin awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated on October 5th, 2013&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Removed the job posting link. The page it linked to is long gone.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Crimson Skies Notes</title>
      <link>https://ggr.com/crimson-skies-notes.html</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2003 20:13:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ggr.com/crimson-skies-notes.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;MS just released their &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox/crimson-skies-high-road-to-revenge&#34;&gt;sequel to &lt;em&gt;Crimson Skies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the Xbox. Heh heh, they &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; its a good game and they want it to help drive purchases of the Xbox and subscriptions to Xbox Live. I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to take some notes down about the original for some time because it was a game I enjoyed and I thought it worth reflecting on why I enjoyed it as much as I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At its core &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/crimson-skies&#34;&gt;Crimson Skies&lt;/a&gt; is a crappy flight simulator. By &amp;ldquo;crappy&amp;rdquo; I mean fun. :) They traded away the realism one can find in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/flight-simulator-2002&#34;&gt;Flight Simulator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; series for something much more arcade-like. Instead of worrying about aerodynamics, you can worry about pointing your guns at the enemy while the plane takes care of itself. For most people, myself included, easy-of-use trumps realism in the making of a fun flight game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, so its another flight game, right? Well yah, it&amp;rsquo;s a flight game, like many, many others before it. Its basically an arcade style flight game. The graphics are nice, but nothing truly spectacular even for the time it was released. But the game is hella &lt;em&gt;fun&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Is It Fun?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breaking down the graphics, the gameplay, the sound quality, and all the technical attributes is very misleading with this game. Everything is pretty good, but nothing it terribly revolutionary&amp;hellip;so its taken me a while to figure out how this game pulls of being so fun:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Its easy to jump into the game and play without much knowledge of the interface. Console players take this sort of ease-of-use for granted, but its not that common on PCs. The low barrier to entry and low time commitment makes me more likely to play between the busy events in my life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The story is good! The designers of this game really took the time to come up with a cool story world complete with funky settings, discernible characters, and a plot that keeps things moving. It gives the game great forward momentum and its so well done that I&amp;rsquo;ve never given its entirely linear nature a second thought. Its so much fun that it transcends its linear plot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But what really made the immersion possible was the sound. The voice acting is superb. The voice actors are well matched to their characters and the recordings are high quality. They are used enough within missions and between missions to keep the player immersed. The sound is the real engine of fun in this game&amp;hellip;without it youd have a arcade-style flight sim with some interesting models and levels. With it you have a game that I and a lot of different style gamers I know really enjoy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its really nice to come across a game as fun as Crimson Skies and its even cooler to realize that its fun not because of some flashy, cutting edge technology, but because the designers emphasized good gameplay and a good story world in order to set the stage for the fun.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I emailed &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId=63361/&#34;&gt;RJ Berg&lt;/a&gt; after I finished Alice to tell him how much I liked the game. I also asked why Moby wasnt showing him on Alice in their DB and it turns out the person who put the data in originally missed him. So, I contacted Moby and got them to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mobygames.com/game/sheet/p,3/gameId,2703/&#34;&gt;add his credit&lt;/a&gt; as the executive producer on the project. But he did a lot more than exec produce the game&amp;ndash;he wrote the script and the dialogue while directing the voice and music. I bet he had a blast! I&amp;rsquo;m envious. :) Funny thing is, Jordan Maynard who I &lt;a href=&#34;https://ggr.com/reinforcements.html&#34;&gt;just met&lt;/a&gt; through Erin Turner is the son of David Maynard, a cofounder of EA. And RJ had just met with David about 10 minutes before my email crossed his desk, saying how I had just met someone else who worked on Alice. Heh heh. What are the chances?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the Beginning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href=&#34;https://ggr.com/eas-biz-side.html&#34;&gt;met RJ&lt;/a&gt; a couple months back when I was just starting to get a handle on the industry. I had just finished reading &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Get-Game-Careers-Industry/dp/0735713073&#34;&gt;Get in the Game&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and I had talked to a couple recruiters about the ways of the industry. Actually most recruiters wouldnt give a guy like me much help since they only place people with game experience (i.e. I cant make them any money), but &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.linkedin.com/in/acheren&#34;&gt;Andy Cheren&lt;/a&gt; took the time to answer my questions and make very helpful suggestions. I will definitely be going back to him when the day comes for me to use a recruiter. I met Andy through &lt;a href=&#34;https://ggr.com/eala-connection.html&#34;&gt;Richard Kane&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I digress. :) RJ was a big help&amp;ndash;he read over my early resume and helped me make it more game industry compatible. Hes provided me with great advice along the way even though hes extremely busy. He got exactly what my challenges were with transitioning from biz software to game software right away and he encouraged me to see that my experience is very valuable to the game industry, but I&amp;rsquo;ll need to take a creative approach to get in front of the right people. His experience is just invaluable to someone like me, I&amp;rsquo;m really lucky to have someone like him helping me out! Hes even offered to put in a good word for me when I go out for interviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he produced Alice! :)&lt;/p&gt;

      <pubDate>Mon, 27 Oct 2003 12:42:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ggr.com/reinforcements.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A number of weeks ago I had lunch with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,100938/&#34;&gt;Erin Turner&lt;/a&gt; at the Sofitel hotel near the EA campus. Come to think of it, it was labor day or something. And of course, being a producer and all, Erin was in the office that day. :) Shes leading the charge on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-2/james-bond-007-everything-or-nothing&#34;&gt;next Bond game&lt;/a&gt; after all, and she was wrapping pre-beta. I was plunking away on the piano when she walked up and we went to grab lunch nearby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, We Get To Chatting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erin &lt;a href=&#34;http://etl.stanford.edu/handouts/0304_aut_speakerbio/ErinTurner.htm&#34;&gt;started off&lt;/a&gt; in film before co-founding and serving as CEO of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Gigabeat+Opens+Its+Gateway+to+Liquid+Audio+and+Strengthens+Its+Music...-a063320265&#34;&gt;Gigabeat&lt;/a&gt; at the ripe old age of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.stanford.edu/class/msande273/images/redHerring.pdf&#34;&gt;24&lt;/a&gt;. After returning to film for a short while, she decided to pitch an EA producer on an idea and ended up landing a gig as associate producer with the Bond franchise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She told me about her adventures in the industry and we got to talking about how the game industry isnt exactly bursting with networking opportunities, though it&amp;rsquo;s very important to know the right people in order to get stuff done. We started brainstorming a bit about what we could do to get some of the people in NoCal area together. We came up with some good ideas; I suspect well be picking up that conversation thread again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And She Introduces Me To Jordan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erin offered to put in a good word where she could in EA and told me to ping her when I got a lead. When I heard about EAP I sent her a quick email and a few days later I heard from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,77144/&#34;&gt;Jordan Maynard&lt;/a&gt; who offered to help! I guess he spoke with Erin, checked out my website and thought it was cool. He said the Penny Arcade link was what pushed me over into the &amp;ldquo;hes a real gamer&amp;rdquo; zone. I thought I owed the PA guys a couple beers &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt;. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jordans got one of the sweetest roles I&amp;rsquo;ve heard of yet. Hes a technical designer&amp;ndash;a newer role for EA and much of the industry I suspect. He takes game engines and figures out how to design &lt;em&gt;fun&lt;/em&gt; games that play to the engines strengths. The upshot of that is that fewer resources are needed to battle the technology and more are available for other aspects of making a good game and bring it to market. Jordan worked on &lt;a href=&#34;https://ggr.com/alice-notes.html&#34;&gt;Alice&lt;/a&gt; too (as did RJ)&amp;hellip;he did a bunch of the scripting on the cut scenes. Like when the Jabberwocky smacks Alice. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hes offered to help out and he knows the guys on the EAP team. He comes from a line of entrepreneurs and gamers too, his dad, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,183/&#34;&gt;David Maynard&lt;/a&gt; cofounded EA (which, basically makes him a legend). Its incredibly cool of him to offer to help me out. Its just awesome to keep meeting these great people at EA.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A couple days ago &lt;a href=&#34;https://ggr.com/the-campaign-begins.html&#34;&gt;Rob&lt;/a&gt; emailed me letting me know that he had pitched me to EA Partners and they were interested in speaking with me. :) As I understand it, EAP is looking for producer-types at an array of levels to help manage their relationships with outside studios, I&amp;rsquo;m guessing on one or a handful of projects at a time. Today I received an email from EA&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://careers.ea.com/&#34;&gt;job engine&lt;/a&gt; with more details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They posted for associate and assistant producers (I&amp;rsquo;m just assuming these are the same positions Rob told me about). They both look like great positions, but especially with the associate position I can see what Rob was talking about when he said EAP was interested in my background managing vendor relationships and contracts. They want someone that will help grow their investment in outside studios (starting with a single game) into a franchise that makes money on a long-term basis. It sounds like &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; the kind of thing Id like to do. Franchise building is one of the talents I most admire in EA and one of the big reasons I want to work there. EA is one of the few companies that has the resources and knowhow to build properties that make money past the first game (like &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madden_NFL&#34;&gt;Madden&lt;/a&gt; and The Sims).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I got word from Rob I might hear from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId=58863/&#34;&gt;Tom Frisina&lt;/a&gt; at EAP, I checked him out at Moby to see who we might know in common. Nothing jumped out at me on the first pass. Then I remembered that Erin Turner had offered to see what she could do to help when I let her know who I was trying to make a good impression with. Sent her a quick email letting her know whats going on.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My friend &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.summation.net/&#34;&gt;Auren Hoffman&lt;/a&gt; just sent me a copy of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Games-411-Professional-Reference-Industry/dp/1931625247&#34;&gt;Games 411&lt;/a&gt; out of the blue. Nice! I was &lt;a href=&#34;https://ggr.com/game-girl-advance-and-411.html&#34;&gt;planning&lt;/a&gt; on getting this. Turns out the publisher is Andrew Boer. He used to be the VP of Sales for BridgePath (a company I cofounded in 1997, &lt;a href=&#34;http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=137922&#34;&gt;acquired&lt;/a&gt; in 2002) before he left to get his MBA over at Harvard. I wonder how he came to be involved with this project&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;American McGee must be friends with Tim Burton. I decided to drop $8 for a copy of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/american-mcgees-alice&#34;&gt;Alice&lt;/a&gt;. Heck, I&amp;rsquo;ve spoken to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,63361/&#34;&gt;producer&lt;/a&gt; and a bunch of friends have recommended the game. Took me about 20 hours to play through. The graphics were funthey set the mood of wandering through this land of dark imagination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excellent Interface&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The music was good. The menus were excellent, starting with the startup sequence with the EA logo turning into the Cat, accompanied by light laughter turning into twisted laughter. The lighting effects and the candle in the main menu help set the tone, and the other menus were great too. These interface details are often shortchanged in games, but Alice puts them to use setting the mood, with great effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game feels absolutely solid from a technology standpoint. Its based on the Quake 3 engine. Load times are fast and you can save &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; having to interrupt gameplay. Very, very nice! The smoothness of the game experience, starting with the menus and the interface, is one I wish I could find in a lot of other games, but alas no. Alice is rather unusual in this respect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But the gameplay got old&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sick and twisted world of Alices imagination is great. Lots of interesting areas thoughtfully designed. The game is fun to look at and play through simply for the aesthetics. However, it was only able to keep me immersed for the first few levels&amp;hellip;after that it started to feel a bit formulaic: another interesting &lt;em&gt;looking&lt;/em&gt; level with some more bad guys and a jumping puzzle. The storyline with Alice overcoming the trauma of her parents death was over explained, sucking out the mystery. Further, it just started to feel like Quake towards the end. For some reason it just lost the immersion. Maybe it was inevitable because the initial wonder wore off, or maybe it was missing something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I&amp;rsquo;m going to go with the missing something option. System Shock 2 and HomeWorld (heck, and Kings Quest) kept me in the game throughout. And System Shock 2 is even formulaic in that it has bad guys to shoot and find the key style puzzles. But the world and the story were so well blended that in SS2 I didnt notice. I was too worried about monkeys. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So the question is, what could have been different?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hindsight is 20/20 right? But that doesnt make me a good game designer. :) Lets see though&amp;hellip;I think being a bit more subtle about the storyline would have been nice&amp;hellip;make the player feel like they have to work a little to figure it out. Maybe less of an emphasis on combat as things moved along. I guess the game just needed more story and less FPS. The initial levels really grabbed me because I felt like I was wondering through this unpredictable new world. The later levels lost me because it became predictable and the spaces between significant story elements was much longer. The music was good, but it could have been less generic by level. It stopped affecting my mood as things went along, I suspect it wasnt well matched to the gameplay at those points&amp;hellip;or that it just wasnt able to create the mood on its own after I had heard the same piece over and over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the bosses were so boss like. It felt sorta out of place. I&amp;rsquo;m not playing Mario here&amp;hellip;I guess I was expecting something a little less formula once again. Maybe it would have been better without the bosses at all&amp;hellip;take the emphasis away from combat and put it on something else. Maybe a riddle or something. Though I know those are hard because riddles have the effect of segmenting your audience by cultural biases, intellect, and care for riddles. Game design is tough! :p&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, overall though&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey, it was a fun game. The first few levels were superbreally drew me in and surprised me. There need to be more games with Alices attention to detail in the menus and interface elements. Alice was a fun, creative effort and I&amp;rsquo;m glad I finally played it!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mage In SF, LARPs</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Writing about RPGs has gotten me all misty eyed for my pen-and-paper days past. I though Id try and find a game of &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mage:_The_Ascension&#34;&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt; in the Bay Area. Posted on &lt;a href=&#34;http://sfbay.craigslist.org/act/&#34;&gt;Craigslist&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://forums.white-wolf.com/default.aspx?g=topics&amp;amp;f=33&#34;&gt;forums&lt;/a&gt; for Mage, but I havent turned up much. After looking at the limited level of Internet chatter related to the game these day, I&amp;rsquo;m starting to think there arent that many people playing Mage. So sad. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll just have to storytell a game myself, or perhaps consider other game worlds like &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vampire:_The_Masquerade&#34;&gt;Vampire&lt;/a&gt; or D&amp;amp;D.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m finding a good amount of chatter around LARPs though. Jane has given LARPs a shot and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gamegirladvance.com/2003/10/nero-nearly-killed-me.html&#34;&gt;survived&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;ve only had one LARP experience about 4 years ago, and I didnt find it nearly as fun as pen-and-paper. My LARPs experience was similar to my MMORPG experiences so far&amp;ndash;heavier on the interaction than the imagination. There was lots of stuff going on, cool costumes, etc., but I competed with 40 other people for prominence in the plot. Costumes and 3D rendered environments never seem to match the richness of the unrendered worlds created in my head when I&amp;rsquo;m playing a tabletop game. I think each of these medium has their strengths, but most people still try to shoehorn the strengths of pen-and-paper RPGs into them. Perhaps they require and deserve their own gameplay paradigm. I bet that well really see them come into their own over the next 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Homeworld 2 Notes</title>
      <link>https://ggr.com/homeworld-2-notes.html</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 19 Oct 2003 05:02:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ggr.com/homeworld-2-notes.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Picked up a copy of &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeworld_2&#34;&gt;HW2&lt;/a&gt;. You could say I opened the box with some anticipationthe &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeworld&#34;&gt;first one&lt;/a&gt; remains one of my favorite games. It was immersive&amp;ndash;the story was engaging, the sound built and maintained the mood, and the interface still is the easiest 3D RTS I&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen. As for the sequel it has spawned, HW2 gives a great first impression&amp;ndash;the production quality is certainly there. The graphics, interface, and sound have all taken evolutionary steps that are great to see. Lightning, however, did not strike twice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I kept wondering what was missing from this game. Its beautiful to look at, it sounds great, the interface is much improved. Maybe it was just the story&amp;hellip;I didnt care. Somehow the story was less three dimensional than the ships that flew through it. The first game managed to strike an almost magical balance where each part of the game worked together like an instrument in a professional orchestra to produce the subtle tones and brilliant sounds that move an audience with their song. Homeworld 2 had the technical competence, but the story didnt rise to the same level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more games I play, the more I become aware of just how difficult it must be to write a good story and then orchestrate the instruments of a game to bring it to life. More often than not, game studios focus on what they can control&amp;ndash;the technical content. I guess they calculate that it is better to work on bump mapping and lighting effects than become embroiled in the quagmire of authoring a good gameworld. I wonder if they are setting themselves up to compete for second place&amp;rsquo;then again, maybe they really just want to target a smaller niche. Not every title need be a blockbuster to make money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I daresay that LucasArts doesn&amp;rsquo;t owe its success to superior technology. They have a better franchise&amp;ndash;a game world that the players want to be a part of. I wonder how a game studio could do by focusing on building a compelling game world &lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt;, with the technology ever the servant of the story. Maybe this is what some companies try to do by licensing a world from the movies or a book. Considering the bad name movie tie-ins have, I suspect too many of them use the world they&amp;rsquo;ve licensed as a static backdrop rather than as the creative engine of the game.&lt;/p&gt;

      <pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2003 14:57:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;People like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,31174/&#34;&gt;Matt Lewis&lt;/a&gt; are why I like the Bay Area. Totally cool guy&amp;hellip;we met for drinks last night at this &lt;a href=&#34;http://sanfrancisco.citysearch.com/review/11484104/editorial/?cslink=cs_profile_tabs_editorial_review&#34;&gt;chill bar&lt;/a&gt; with no sign (keeps the unclued out, I guess) and we chatted a bit about games. I was introduced to Matt through my friend Ben, who is friends with Matts roommate (3 degrees). Matt worked as a mid-level QA dude on the publishers side of The Sims a few years back and he told me that EA Redwood Shores is a great place to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matt started at EA doing end-user tech support back in the days before customer support was split off from QA at EA. He worked his way up to doing QA on &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/sid-meiers-alpha-centauri&#34;&gt;Alpha Centauri&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;The Sims&lt;/em&gt;. The whole thing was an amazing experience he said. &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Wright_(game_designer)&#34;&gt;Will Wright&lt;/a&gt; was an accessible, visionary, fun guy to work with. &lt;em&gt;The Sims&lt;/em&gt; and the people on it were amazing. But, he left afterwards to patch up a personal life that had been badly neglected during his tour of duty. We agreed that &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; would need to be the topic of a future discussion, especially since I&amp;rsquo;m working on the section about burnout in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ggr.com/igda-and-the-good-life.html&#34;&gt;IGDA QoL whitepaper&lt;/a&gt;. Oh, and he mentioned that producer-types work like dogs. Testers and producers pull the longest hours. Good to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between beers we talked about the seminal experiences in our gaming lives. How RPGs and board games are so much fun because they are social in a manner that few computer games even try to imitate. Matt knows a guy that knows the designer behind &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/american-mcgees-alice&#34;&gt;Alice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;lsquo;and I was reminded I need to pick up a copy. I know the producer, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t played the thing yet. He also recommended &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-2/socom-us-navy-seals&#34;&gt;SOCOM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; which I&amp;rsquo;ll have to check out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s pretty amazing to me how diverse and cool the people I meet in the industry are. Matt&amp;rsquo;s got an interest in sales, politics, and film along with experience in Japan (his dad was stationed there) to add to his love of games. He&amp;rsquo;s even started working on a board game of his own, and why not? He&amp;rsquo;s even got a friend that makes board games for a living to help show him the ropes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m starting to see a pattern here. As &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0316346624/qid=1066256602/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/102-8710864-0356966?v=glance&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;n=507846&#34;&gt;The Tipping Point&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; notes, most people meet new people at 3 to 4 degrees of separation. You share so much overlap with people closer, and you are more likely to already know there interests and share them whereas the further away you go, the larger the group and the more diverse. BUT, at 3-4 away, you are still close enough to have a warm enough connection to say, grab a beer and chat.&lt;/p&gt;

      <pubDate>Fri, 10 Oct 2003 15:16:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ggr.com/pdi-dreamworks.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just got off the phone with Mark Kirk of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pdi.com/&#34;&gt;PDI-Dreamworks&lt;/a&gt;. Hes the former neighbor of my dads friend Phil (thats 3 degrees). Hes working on some really interesting stuff&amp;ndash;he started in IT (got introduced to the company by a friend who was getting his masters degree in graphics) and now builds the project and asset management/project pipeline tool for PDI. Basically, he makes it easier for everyone to do their piece on a film and seamlessly pass things to the next person for the work they need to do, all the while maintaining a great deal of transparency and insight into where things are on the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His job reminded me of a gig I did for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.strongtie.com/&#34;&gt;Simpson&lt;/a&gt;, building a web based system for managing their huge, complicated new product process. He isnt familiar with the game side of things over there, but he recommended I look into EA. :) Its interesting to see another person who started IT who got in through a friend and stayed IT, but in a creative industry. Food for thought!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not too many posts this week&amp;ndash;I had jury duty (which isnt over) and a few other non-gaming items to take care of. Even so, the SS IP moved forward a bit more and I heard from Rob at EA that hes trying to get me in front of some people for some Associate and Assistant Producer positions that may be opening up sometime in the near future. Also met with Mel, a friend whose in PR (hes really good too) about strategies for raising the volume on this campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I thought Id Google this sitesee if it was in the search engine already. I was surprised to find a link from another blogger! Pretty cool. Wonder how he heard about the site? So far I&amp;rsquo;ve told so few people about itmy main avenue of exposure so far is through people who I email from the domain. They sometimes notice the address. I also &amp;lsquo;ping&amp;rsquo; a couple blog portals to let them know I&amp;rsquo;ve posted something. I&amp;rsquo;m going to go email this guy and ask him. Come to think of it, I probably should start thinking about raising the sites profile now that I&amp;rsquo;ve got some material up.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cooperative Multiplayer</title>
      <link>https://ggr.com/cooperative-multiplayer.html</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 01 Oct 2003 06:08:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ggr.com/cooperative-multiplayer.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the best things about &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Shock_2&#34;&gt;System Shock 2&lt;/a&gt; was the cooperative multiplayer game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days most games I come across are either single-player, plot-driven (games like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thesims.com/&#34;&gt;The Sims&lt;/a&gt; being the exception) or multiplayer interaction-driven. And when I say single-player games are plot-driven, I mean it to include a broad range of plot complexities. Some of these plot-driven &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.planettribes.com/allyourbase/AYB2.swf&#34;&gt;games&lt;/a&gt; have rather pitiful plots, i.e. Earth is being invaded by aliens and you, the last super badass are all that stands in the way of total destruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I get the impression that most plots are strapped onto what is essentially a technology centered game. Id guess that a lot of studios or publishers feel one must have some sort of story in a single player game, but as long as the graphics are pretty enough, it doesnt need to be much of one. In multiplayer game the theory seems to go: if you put enough people in a game together, they will make their own story and we dont have to worry all that much about it. Or, if a story isnt appropriate for the given game, at least having human opponents will keep the players entertained for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social Gaming Roots&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is why the cooperative multiplayer aspect of System Shock 2 shined so brightly in my eyes. I have been a gamer my whole life, and my most enjoyable experiences with games have been social ones, even though I&amp;rsquo;ve really enjoyed some single player games too (and I like a good book). I starting playing &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0880387297/qid=1065198479/sr=1-2/ref=sr_1_2/104-7698839-5997554?v=glance&amp;amp;s=books%3EAD&amp;amp;D%E2%80%9D%3C/a%3E,%20%3Ca%20target=&#34;&gt;GURPS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vampire:_The_Masquerade&#34;&gt;Vampire&lt;/a&gt;, and other RPGs in junior-high, and I&amp;rsquo;ve never lost my love for them. These were all games that were plot-driven, cooperative multiplayer. My friends and I got together and formed a team that was essentially there to play a variation of that ancient standby: pretend. Or cops and robbers. There is, I suspect, a very good reason these games are ancient standbys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even my experience with the consummate episodal game, Counter-Strike, reinforces this theme in my gaming life. I loved Half-Life single player, and it was even fun in free-for-all multiplayer sessions. But its at its best when I&amp;rsquo;m playing the CS mod with a group of friends as a social gathering. We plot, we plan, we talk about the game, we create a team logo, a team persona. We plan a trip to paintball after a night of &lt;em&gt;working together to have fun&lt;/em&gt;. Id bet some good money that part of the success CS has enjoyed over its predecessors and many games that have come after it are essentially &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/2003/03/18/bunten/index.html&#34;&gt;social&lt;/a&gt; in nature. In CS you form a team that must really work together well to have staying power&amp;ndash;the fan sites and clans that have developed around the game may be demonstrations of this idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;System Shock 2 was a special treat, because I got the chance to play through a really fun plot with a group of friends, working together. It became an eagerly anticipated social event. We would talk about the game between sessions and review the parts we enjoyed most. It was an experience that has never been matched by the best movie because I got to both participate in the plot as a character, and I got to enjoy the experience with a &lt;em&gt;team&lt;/em&gt; of friends who, through their interaction with the game expanded the plot and meaning of the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What About MMPOGs and RPGs?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MMPOGs have hoped that given a game world and a bunch of people, plots and engaging game play will sort of just appear on their own. Keeps costs down, and it seems like a great idea on the surface, but I havent seen it happen. 100,000 people dont seem any better at writing a story together in a MMPOG than they would be writing a book, and if you form a subgroup of 4 people in the game world and start making your own game of it, the MMPOG turns into more of a distraction to your game than an enhancement. Not to say that MMPOGs wont find their own unique style of play that will be a ton of fun for a lot of people, but they havent yet captured that special something that I and a lot of my friends are looking for in games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest generation of computer based RPGs like &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vampire:_The_Masquerade_%E2%80%93_Redemption&#34;&gt;Vampire: Redemption&lt;/a&gt; and Neverwinter Nights have tried to harness aspects of the social dynamics of gaming by providing gamers with tools that resemble traditional roleplaying tools. This doesnt seem to be working all that well either. I suspect the problem relates to the large amount of time one must invest to fully realize a game session. With a pen and paper RPG, you need only design the plot, the major characters, and maybe some basic maps. The rest is left to expand upon though the collaborative efforts of the game master/story teller and the players. To game in a similar manner, but augmented by a 3D FPS environment, one must explicitly create all the visual and auditory details that make up the world. All of them. This just takes too friggin much time &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; technical+artistic talent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cooperative Multiplayer and Old School RPG Worlds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this has gotten me thinking about what kind of games I would like to make someday. I somehow managed to neglect to mention this &lt;a href=&#34;https://ggr.com/system-shock-3.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, but a major reason I want to make SS3 is to have the opportunity to take the great cooperative multiplayer experience they created and expand upon it. I&amp;rsquo;ve also started to think about what a great resource pen and paper RPGs could be to gaming. These games have been helping gamers play in non-linear worlds for years. The writing and materials are well adapted to that purpose and their writers have unique experience in writing &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranoia_(role-playing_game)&#34;&gt;materials&lt;/a&gt; for the non-linear game environment. But more on that soon. :)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was thinking the other day about what should happen to this domain once I land a gig at EA. What Id like to do is find someone whose trying to get a gig at EA like I was and hand the steering wheel off to them so they can add &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; experiences. I&amp;rsquo;ll contribute advice and insight into my experience from the inside as well as help this person along. The domain would become a repository for the stories of people trying to get into the industry (and EA specifically), passing from one aspiring game person to the next. Just like the &lt;a href=&#34;http://princessbrideforever.com/&#34;&gt;Dread Pirate Roberts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Maxis Tour</title>
      <link>https://ggr.com/the-maxis-tour.html</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 01 Oct 2003 04:03:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ggr.com/the-maxis-tour.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last night I got the full tour of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxis&#34;&gt;Maxis&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,78802/&#34;&gt;Toby Roberts&lt;/a&gt;, a central leader in their IT operation. Met Toby through my friend &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mylife.com/katrina-sewell&#34;&gt;Kat Sewell&lt;/a&gt; and we all went to grab &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pfchangs.com/&#34;&gt;dinner&lt;/a&gt; after. Man, what a cool place Maxis is! I cant even begin to describe the energetic atmosphere in those colorful halls. And I cant even begin to tell you all the cool shit they are working on because of the NDA I had to sign before entering. :p But lemme just say theres some awesome stuff coming down the pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toby and I talked SAN strategies for a bit while a checked out their server room. Kat politely stood by as we dorked out on stuff like their new 100 TB tape library that can hit 600 GB/sec of transfer across its fibre channel connect. All the numbers get really cool at a place like Maxis. I checked out the machines that were building the next generation of games and then I got to see them being worked on in development, audio, marketing, art, and test. It was a lot of fun!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toby tells me that there are maybe 4 development directors at Maxis, but more producers and associate producers, so DD may be a harder position to come by even though my skill lean towards that sort of role. He offered to introduce me to some Maxis recruiters and suggested QA wouldnt be the ideal place to start. I let him know that I thought would enjoy the experience and learn a lot even soit may not be the most glorious position but I could pick up some industry know-how while I look for a position in production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hes looking for Java and PHP gurus on his team&amp;hellip;wish I had those skills, but I have only basic level skills in those areas. I&amp;rsquo;m an MS IT guru and pretty good with MS dev tools like VB, SQL, ASP, and VBA as well, but Maxis is more of a unix shop in the back room. But perhaps other game companies will have MS IT opportunitiessomething to keep my eyes open for. Even though I want to end up in production, getting into the industry is the first step!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And dont even bother to try and break into one of Maxiss serving or archive facilities. The security procedures are nuts. If the President is even in danger, he should hide out at a Maxis server drop. Its right out of spy movie with the hand scans and multilayer protections before you get access to the sanctus sanctorium of data.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I just applied to a couple positions with MSs Xbox team in Redmond. I know, I know they &lt;em&gt;arent&lt;/em&gt; EA, but I figure I need to keep my options open. They are growing fast and they are more familiar with how to leverage my kind of biz software production experience in the game space, increasing my appeal, which is good. I&amp;rsquo;ve got a few friends at MS that could help me navigate the place and I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with them before. Could be a good step on my way to working at EA. :)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Found out I&amp;rsquo;m going to be a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rootsweb.com/~vatgs/cousins_chart.htm&#34;&gt;first cousin once removed&lt;/a&gt; by my cousin Stew. He and his wife are both in digital animation. She teaches and hes got a gig with Disney. He introduced me to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,186176/&#34;&gt;Dave Kury&lt;/a&gt; (a college friend of his from UCLA animation) about a month back, who working for &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EA_Los_Angeles&#34;&gt;EALA&lt;/a&gt; as the lead animator on the next Medal of Honor. He introduced me to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId=76051/&#34;&gt;Rick Kane&lt;/a&gt;, an EA producer who gave me some good advice and the latest on EA new EALA studio that is close to completion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Producers are especially fun to talk to because they do the same stuff I do in biz software, but in games with all its unique challenges. Rick told me about his role, how he works with his associate producers, how he got to where he is. We also talked about EALA and EA&amp;rsquo;s push to get closer to Hollywood. Seems like LA may be a place to keep in mindand considering I lived there for 5 years and have a lot of family in the area a position there would certainly be cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rick was a bit harder to get a hold of compared to other producers I&amp;rsquo;ve spoken with (and they are all hard to get a hold of, believe me)&amp;ndash;testament to the busy work lives they lead. They are the people filling in all the gaps and running the overall game project. I get the impression they also work some of the longest hours. There is &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; more work for the producer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Find Your Bliss</title>
      <link>https://ggr.com/find-your-bliss.html</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 26 Sep 2003 01:11:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ggr.com/find-your-bliss.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Didnt think Id post one every day did you? :) My friend &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.linkedin.com/in/donoho&#34;&gt;Brian Donoho&lt;/a&gt; drove his old trainer bike all the way from Sunnyvale to loan it to me so I can practice. He says it has as much pickup as a lawnmower, but it should get me around the parking lot just fine. Brian joined Nonsequiter studios a little while ago and we got to talking about the game industry over &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.zacharys.com/&#34;&gt;Zacharys&lt;/a&gt; and some more on the drive back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonsequiter is a group of guys in the Bay Area that follow the game industry and discuss game design for kicks. A few of us have been thinking about making something which was part of the impetus for researching the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ggr.com/system-shock-3.html&#34;&gt;SS3 idea&lt;/a&gt;. I think SS3 may be more than we should bite off as a first project, but it&amp;rsquo;s put some good issues on the table and its brought some focus to the discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, Brian and I are eating some of the best pizza that money can buy, and we get to talking about my new campaign to get a gig with EA. He asks me about how much fun I&amp;rsquo;m having, and I evade and basically say that I&amp;rsquo;m not having much fun looking for a gig, it will be fun &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; I get there. And Brian asks why I want to work in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Do I Want To Work In Games?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love that question. I talk about all the reasons Id like to work in the industry. Its creative. It incorporates the cutting edge in AI, physics, sociology, and other areas of academic study. Its a business. Its software. I&amp;rsquo;ve been a gamer, a software creator, and an entrepreneur my whole life, but I&amp;rsquo;ve never combined all of my passions together. I can hardly believe I hadnt thought of it before&amp;hellip;it has the potential to be just incredible. But getting &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt;, well, I have never particularly enjoyed the process of looking for job opportunities, I figure its just part of the price to play!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brian asks me why I&amp;rsquo;m not enjoying the process. And I tell him the challenges of not knowing whether I&amp;rsquo;m going in the right direction are the hardestthe blood and sweat required to attain a goal has never been a problem for me (heck, I founded 3 companies so far), but not knowing if my work is even contributing toward that goal can be tough! No one likes to spin their wheels and waste effort. Thats when Brian brings me back to reality&amp;ndash;he points out that my trouble is that I&amp;rsquo;m not enjoying the process, not what I do or dont know. I&amp;rsquo;m treating this too much like work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Light Bulb Turns On&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holy shit, exactly. The whole reason I want get into game production is because I really believe it may be &amp;lsquo;my bliss.&amp;rsquo; I dont know where I heard the term &amp;lsquo;finding your bliss&amp;rsquo; first, but the way I think of it is this: if you are doing what you love, you will enjoy your life AND kick ass at what you do. I need to take a deep breath, take myself out of mission impossible, take the hill mode, and have some fun here. Thats what I&amp;rsquo;m doing it for in the first place! I&amp;rsquo;m a workaholic, take the hill person by nature anyway. I dont really need to focus on working my ass off, I need to take care of keeping inline with what I&amp;rsquo;m really passionate about so that my work isnt just productive. I&amp;rsquo;ve already got that in my current line of work. I&amp;rsquo;m shooting for worthwhile, fulfilling, and fun too&amp;hellip;thats the whole point!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now the question is, how do I have fun with this? I think first thing I&amp;rsquo;m going to do is throw my internal timeline out the window and focus on just enjoying the industry and who I meet in gaming as much as I can. Id like to land a gig someday, but if I focus on that I think it can be self defeating. Screw that. I&amp;rsquo;m going to have a good time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Game Girl Advance And 411</title>
      <link>https://ggr.com/game-girl-advance-and-411.html</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 24 Sep 2003 12:02:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rss&#34;&gt;subscribe&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gamegirladvance.com/&#34;&gt;Game Girl Advance&lt;/a&gt; and they mentioned this &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cruxshadows.com/&#34;&gt;goth band&lt;/a&gt; in an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gamegirladvance.com/archives/2003/09/18/gamers_and_goths.html&#34;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; about how the goth scene is full of gamers. The band was in SF Tuesday so I went to check them out and I thought they were pretty good! Theyve got their own Sims skins5 too. :) That evening, after the evening of ear blasting and all things black, I stumbled across a little gem known as 411 publishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could be a real time saver: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1931625212/qid%3D1064441379/sr%3D11-1/ref%3Dsr%5F11%5F1/104-7698839-5997554&#34;&gt;all the contact info&lt;/a&gt; for the game industry in one place. Well see how current it is. I spend a lot of time tracking down contact info when I want to get in touch with a particular person in the industry, so this could definitely be nice. 411 is affiliated with the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.interactive.org/&#34;&gt;Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences&lt;/a&gt;. Hmm. They are attempting to leverage the Academy of Arts and Sciences brand into the interactive space&amp;hellip;I&amp;rsquo;m going to email some of my contacts in the industry and see what they know about them. First time I&amp;rsquo;ve heard of em.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>System Shock 3</title>
      <link>https://ggr.com/system-shock-3.html</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2003 12:24:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ggr.com/system-shock-3.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Like &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; else in the game industry, I too have a pet game idea or two. Having read most of the production articles at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gamasutra.com/category/production/&#34;&gt;Gamasutra&lt;/a&gt; and much of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sloperama.com/advice.html&#34;&gt;Sloperama&lt;/a&gt; I realize that like most software and unlike Athena, games do not spring forth from your head fully formed. So a few weeks ago I started looking into just what it would take to build a game myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start With an Idea, Add Salt&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started with the conceptthe 5 minutes of inspiration that forms the easiest part of the process. I loved &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/system-shock-2&#34;&gt;System Shock 2&lt;/a&gt;, it was one of the most &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/1999/08/13&#34;&gt;engrossing &lt;/a&gt; games I&amp;rsquo;ve played and I had always hoped for a third installment in the series. A third game did not (and does not) appear forthcoming&amp;hellip;I can only assume that the 2nd wasnt enough of a financial success to justify one (or that the IP is to much of a mess, but more on that latter). So I got to thinking about how cool it would be to have a sequel built in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_(game_engine)&#34;&gt;Source engine&lt;/a&gt; of Half-Life 2 fame. There is a nice sized cult following for the series that could help buzz a good sequel, the HL2 engine looks spectacular and would attract some attention to the games that used it. I figured there was some commercial potential there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What It Takes To Make a Game&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Searching the web up and down, I came up with these numbers: AAA titles take about 100k-400k hours to develop and probably another 100% of that to bring to market. The last price I had heard for licensing the Quake engine was $1m up front plus royalties. Licensing the engine would cut down on development a lot, but I checked my bank account today, and nope, I dont have $1m in there yet. And if I can somehow manage to hold down a job while I build the game, working alone at 40 hrs a week it would take me 48 years to complete a 100k hour game. And that&amp;rsquo;s assuming I can produce as efficiently as a team of experienced specialists. Maybe after year 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well I&amp;rsquo;m glad I took the couple hours to fully assemble that reality check. A triple-A title is like a blockbuster film, you have to have tons of money and an experienced team&amp;ndash;no way around it. Since I&amp;rsquo;ve never enjoyed raising money that much and I&amp;rsquo;d have little chance of doing it in an industry that I have no contacts and experience in, I figured it was time to think about what it would take to make a low budget game, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/el-mariachi-1993&#34;&gt;El Mariachi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; style. Maybe instead of building SS3, I&amp;rsquo;ll &amp;lsquo;port&amp;rsquo; SS2 to the HL2 engine as a mod. Instead of doing it by myself, I&amp;rsquo;ll assemble a team of volunteers that are all interested in learning the skills needed to make a game while producing a product they can show off to potential employers. We&amp;rsquo;ll get to learn the skills we need and produce a demo that might someday lead to greater things. Maybe SS2 for HL would just be a demo to show off our skills, or maybe it would lead to a SS3 project, or maybe the mod itself would be saleable (or useable as a marketing tool to promote SS3 before it is released someday).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ok, So How About a Mod?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does it take to make a mod? I looked at Counter-Strike and Action Half-Life as examples of great mods that I&amp;rsquo;d like to emulate. Although I couldn&amp;rsquo;t come up with any definite numbers from anyone, my guess based on the published timelines and teams for these mods is that each took on the order of 4,000 hours. Now, if I assemble a team that averages 10 people averaging 10 hours a week, it would take a year to produce a mod, including the added overhead that a team of 10 would take over the typically smaller teams. Sweet. That&amp;rsquo;s within the realm of possibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean it would be easy. The posts I&amp;rsquo;ve read on modding have made a few things very clear. Less than 1% of mods that are started make it to the finish line (in fact, I&amp;rsquo;ve come across at least 3 aborted attempts at porting SS2 as mod to other engines in the past few years!). Of those, less that 1% are Counter-Strikes. Recruiting (a seriously hard problem itself) and keeping a team of 10 volunteers motivated on a mod project is going to be the Herculean task. Everyone, including me, is constantly barraged with alternative ways to spend their time and cool volunteer projects have a special challenge in keeping everyone motivated and engaged over the span of an entire year. Even with the best management there will be things that come up and turnover will need to be carefully managed to minimize lost momentum. We&amp;rsquo;ll be changing race car drivers and car parts at 200 mph throughout the project. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to understand why less than 1% of the mods make it&amp;ndash;even if you have the forethought to focus on how the heck to keep a team like this running it would be hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bite Sized Chunks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I figured I should split the project into smaller chunks before continuing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1st project is porting the first couple levels of SS2 to the Source engine, with as little divergence from the original as possible. The major objectives are 1) build a team and tweak the organization to keep everyone motivated and complete a project with volunteers, 2) help everyone learn valuable game making skills in their particular area of interest, 3) learn how to reverse engineer and convert a game (since that&amp;rsquo;s another marketable skill), 4) complete a useable demo that we can use to show off our work, 5) lay the foundation for our next project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2nd project is to take the 1st project and make improvements to take full advantage of the new engine while preserving the original sense of the game. This would produce a new demo, showing off more creative design skills as well as our ability with the engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3rd project would be to build SS3 as mod. We&amp;rsquo;d have a team with all the skills and an organization capable of dealing with the challenges of volunteer based game production, now we would add the complication of an original story and design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Licensing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and there is that tiny matter of IP, like, we don&amp;rsquo;t own the rights to SS2. I spoke with Mikhail Islam of &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrational_Games&#34;&gt;Irrational&lt;/a&gt;, the developer on SS2, and he thinks EA owns the rights to the IP, though that maybe complicated by the &lt;a href=&#34;http://web.archive.org/web/20030201221655/http://www.gamespy.com/legacy/news/may00/5-24-00-1.shtm&#34;&gt;demise&lt;/a&gt; of System Shock 1&amp;rsquo;s development team, if they had any residual IP rights. David Cornish runs the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sshock2.com/&#34;&gt;biggest fansite&lt;/a&gt; for the game and he pointed me to EA too. I emailed &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,31/&#34;&gt;Scott Evans&lt;/a&gt;, a producer on SS2 who works at EA and he referred me to Linda Chaplin in EA strategic sales, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t been able to get a hold of her yet. I figure we can move forward and if they object, they&amp;rsquo;ll certainly let us know. While we&amp;rsquo;d like to be able to share what we make with the world, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t change its value to us much if they say we can&amp;rsquo;t and we just use it as a private demo. It becomes an issue with SS3, but if we can&amp;rsquo;t use the IP then we&amp;rsquo;ll just make a game in that genre and use a different back-story and look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your Mission, Should You Choose To Accept It&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I began this process with a game idea and I&amp;rsquo;ve ended up with a new project&amp;ndash;figuring out how to build a game with a team of volunteers in a replicable manner. If I can figure this one out, I&amp;rsquo;ll have a formula for making substantial independent games, building and training game dev teams from scratch, and doing both without outside investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings us to today. I&amp;rsquo;ve been bouncing ideas off of Ben Durbin, a former CTO friend of mine. He&amp;rsquo;s part of the Pixel Corp where he&amp;rsquo;s joined some film industry veterans who are working on similar challenges in film. They are building and training teams of enthusiasts&amp;ndash;turning them into digital video studios with competitive skills. This could get interesting. :)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Beer At Jupiters</title>

      <guid>https://ggr.com/beer-at-jupiters.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight I decided to grab a beer at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jupiterbeer.com/&#34;&gt;Jupiters&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId=84317/&#34;&gt;Michael Constant&lt;/a&gt;. He left Activision a little while ago to work on a math degree at &lt;a href=&#34;http://berkeley.edu/&#34;&gt;Berkeley&lt;/a&gt; (my alma mater). I met Michael when my friend Melinda brought him to a movie night a couple weeks ago. You worked in gaming you say? We really must talk some more. :) Turns out Michaels a real badass. Hes been mentoring new developers and taking on the bitch ass bugs that no one else has the guts to stare down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was fun talking about the details of PS2 codingthe trade offs because the memory bus is slow, but with 128-bit integers and a fast render it makes more sense to calculate and render everything you can rather than sorting by z-buffer and caching other stuff. But, you still have to do clipping because if you go outside the screen past 30 pixels you hose memory. I forgot how much fun it is to talk to hardcore developers. :) I havent been bumping into people on the street who know assembly and its fun to stretch those muscles!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael gave me a tidbit to pass on to another friend at EA, Erin Turner. Hes figured out the hacks needed to network boot GC and PS2 (easier than GC) that I think Erin may have been looking for, I&amp;rsquo;ll shoot her a quick email. He hasnt seen the EA campus yet, I gotta remember to invite him next time I&amp;rsquo;m down there.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>EA&#39;s Biz Side</title>
      <link>https://ggr.com/eas-biz-side.html</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 22 Sep 2003 10:50:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ggr.com/eas-biz-side.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Thought I would start the week by giving Joel Lizner of EA a call. I was introduced to him through my friend &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.coblentzlaw.com/our-people/jonathan-r-bass/&#34;&gt;Jon Bass&lt;/a&gt;. I never would have guessed he knew people in the industry, but hes introduced me to Joel and to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,63361/&#34;&gt;RJ Berg&lt;/a&gt;, a producer over at LucasArts. It just goes to show that when you are looking to meet people in the industry, tell &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; you can. You never know who all your friends of friends know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joel works the business side like Rob who I met last week. Except that Joel is in charge of a lot of the deal making for the licenses that make many of EA&amp;rsquo;s hottest titles possible. Every time a game uses a trademarked name, leverages an existing franchise, uses some popular music, or enlists an actor (think Harry Potter and Bond) to lend their likeness to a project someones got to negotiate and land the contracts for those licenses. Thats Joels department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It sounds like a lot of fun to me&amp;hellip;I&amp;rsquo;m starting to think I should turn more of my attention on the biz side of things, especially since thats where my background is. I dont have as much background in IP as Joel does, but I can make a more compelling pitch to biz side than to the production side with my current background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joels promised to forward my resume on to the two studio GMs at Redwood Shores and they will likely glance at it and then pass it on to their HR team. Its going to become a familiar sight to them, I think. :)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I joined the &lt;a href=&#34;http://igda.org/&#34;&gt;IGDA&lt;/a&gt;s committee on &lt;a href=&#34;http://wiki.igda.org/Quality_of_Life_SIG&#34;&gt;quality of life&lt;/a&gt; a few weeks ago, offering to bring the newbie perspective to the table. Weve been asked to produce a white paper overviewing the state of the industry from a QoL point of view, to be unveiled at GDC 2004. The whole thing has been pretty illuminating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m getting a health dose of reality from people who have come together to air the industrys dirty laundryall manner of things from unionization to reasons people leave the industry have come up. The industry is suffering from growing pains as well as the popularity that comes with being successful in a down economy. And besides those topics, the cowboy history of the whole thing has combined with the Hollywood, software development, and publishing aspects of the industry to form what we have today. It certainly hasnt turned me off to the industry, but its good to know just what I&amp;rsquo;m diving into. ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marc Mencher of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Get-Game-Careers-Industry/dp/0735713073&#34;&gt;Get In the Game&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; fame and a bunch of industry veterans from all parts of the industry are involved and were just about to break into sub teams and start the heavy lifting. I&amp;rsquo;ll be working on crunch time and job instability and I&amp;rsquo;ve already got a few contacts to interview on the topics. Most everyone agrees that the industry is full of well meaning people who want to take care of their teams, hopefully well find some best practices that will help spread the best ideas an how to do that! If you know anyone who has recently gotten out of the game industry or has some ideas about how to make the industry an even better place to work, be sure to send them my waywere going to start interviewing people in October.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Campaign Begins</title>
      <link>https://ggr.com/the-campaign-begins.html</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 20 Sep 2003 23:55:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ggr.com/the-campaign-begins.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just got back from a fundraiser my friend put on for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.smartvoter.org/2003/11/04/ca/sf/meas/H/&#34;&gt;Prop H&lt;/a&gt; in San Francisco. Ammiano was funny and the vegetable dip was top rate. My friend Mel is threatening to find a way to get &lt;a href=&#34;http://archive.org/details/g4tv.com-video22637&#34;&gt;Georgy&lt;/a&gt; to my next &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forbes.com/infoimaging/free_forbes/2003/0512/127.html&#34;&gt;movie night&lt;/a&gt; because I said that she is cute. But I&amp;rsquo;ve got my own campaign to think about. My campaign to land a gig with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ea.com/locations/redwood-shores&#34;&gt;EA in Redwood City&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve decided I want to work for EA. I thought I just wanted to work in the game industry, but I visited EA in Redwood last week and I was blown away. Rob Moreno, a recruiter there is a friend of a friend and he offered to show me around even though he recruits corporate and I&amp;rsquo;m interested in game production. I just had a great time. EA&amp;rsquo;s got a great campus and Rob really sold me on what a great place EA would be to work. It was already at the top of my list, but after meeting with him I decided to take it up a notch and begin my campaign to work at EA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve got about 10 contacts at EA so far, met mostly through friends of friends, but I have not yet really campaigned to get a job there. In fact, this will be my first campaign for a job ever. I figure with my background the front door just is not going to cut it. I&amp;rsquo;m no John Carmack. I&amp;rsquo;ve got to hit the pavement to get the word out that I want to work at EA, and that I&amp;rsquo;m a good bet for them. I know that I can bring more to the table than my enthusiasm, but I dont expect anyone to take my word for itthis is a competitive industry and I&amp;rsquo;ve got to earn my seat at the table. Time to get to work.&lt;/p&gt;
