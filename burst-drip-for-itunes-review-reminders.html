<h2>Burst &gt; Drip For iTunes Review Reminders</h2>

<p>We email our customers after they receive their first <a href="http://heymosaic.com">Mosaic</a>, asking
them to submit a review to the iTunes (or Google Play) store. We used to send
each email a few days after their package arrived, but we discovered that when
we save up a whole bunch of the reminders, say a month&rsquo;s worth, and send them
all at once, it leads to more reviews, even though its the exact same number of
people contacted, and for some people more time has lapsed between their order
and the email.</p>
<p>Absence makes the heart grow fonder? Seeing a lot of other recent reviews makes
folks more excited to write one of their own? Not sure why it works that way,
but that&rsquo;s how its working for us.</p>
