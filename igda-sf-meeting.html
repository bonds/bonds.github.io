<p>I attended my first IGDA SF meeting last night at the Art Institute (I have a friend that works there too). The meeting centered on a discussion of the newly released whitepaper by the <a href="http://wiki.igda.org/Online_Games_SIG/Steering_Committee">Online Games Committee</a>. John Welch of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shockwave.com">Shockwave.com</a>, Dave Rohrl of <a href="http://www.pogo.com">EA Online</a>, Margaret Wallace of <a href="http://www.skunkstudios.com/">Skunk Studios</a>, and Mark DeLoura of Sony formed the evenings panel with Jennifer Olsen (editor-in-chief of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Developer_Magazine">Game Developer Magazine</a>) moderating.</p>
<p>I was very impressed by Dave, who I felt did an excellent job of presenting his perspective on online gaming and he was just a fun speaker. I finally met Liz Wakefield in person (after a few emails back and forth)&ndash;she chairs the chapter and serves as the operations manager for the IGDA. I spoke to her at <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/buzz-9-cafe-san-francisco">Buzz9</a> afterwards and learned that she majored in English and sorta fell into the role through her job at CMP. But shes still a big gamer. :) She was there with Susan from the GDC&ndash;shes got her hands full preparing for GDC 2004 these days.</p>
<p>I had this great discussion with <a href="http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,4031/">Bill Swartz</a>, Simon (the audio guy&hellip;didnt catch his last name), and a couple others. We talked about what makes a good or a bad producer. Opinions differed by role (some people who havent worn the hat think a good one is hands off, for example), but Bill seemed to win everyone over with the idea that a good producer lays down the law when he needs to, is a strong leader, but gets out of the way when things are on track. Sounds like overlap between biz production and game production to me. :) Bill also made some good points on why EA is cool, and LucasArt (of which I&rsquo;m a fan) has really not capitalized well on its opportunities. Once again I seem to have no problem bumping into EA fans.</p>
<p>But I havent told you much about the presentation yet, I&rsquo;m already at the beer part of the evening. I&rsquo;ll leave you with some tidbits:</p>
<ul>
<li>60 minutes of game play seems to be the maximum it should take to entice a player to upgrade to a paying, enhanced version of the game</li>
<li>But a web or downloaded game must be fun within the first 60 seconds of play because the player is not very invested (i.e. he didnt pay $50) and is unlikely to spend a lot of time trying to find the fun</li>
<li>Sony has shipped 1 million online adapters for the PS/2, but its a cost-center right now. They havent tried to make money on it yet, its a blind investment&ndash;they are laying foundation.</li>
<li>It costs between $50k and $150k to make your average web or downloadable (non-CD) game, so it affords greater experimentation. The budget is in some cases a reflection of bandwidth constraints on the size of the game&ndash;it just doesnt make sense to spend $2m on a 2mb game.
The <a href="http://www.garagegames.com/products/torque-3d">Torque</a> engine is an up-and-comer. Its being sold for $100 by some rich dude who wants to give indies a better chance and hes got the money to sell this $50k tool for $100. It was the only game engine anyone mentioned without rolling their eyes.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m told I will be bumping into <a href="http://www.ignitedusa.com/">IgnitedMinds</a> a lot for some reason. Hmm.</li>
</ul>
