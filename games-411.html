<p>My friend <a href="http://www.summation.net/">Auren Hoffman</a> just sent me a copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Games-411-Professional-Reference-Industry/dp/1931625247">Games 411</a> out of the blue. Nice! I was <a href="/game-girl-advance-and-411.html">planning</a> on getting this. Turns out the publisher is Andrew Boer. He used to be the VP of Sales for BridgePath (a company I cofounded in 1997, <a href="http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=137922">acquired</a> in 2002) before he left to get his MBA over at Harvard. I wonder how he came to be involved with this project</p>

<p>Some of the links were broken. I replaced them with working links to pages with the same or similar content as before.</p>
