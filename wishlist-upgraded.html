<p>I moved my wishlist from Amazon to <a href="http://camelcamelcamel.com">CamelCamelCamel</a>. I use my wishlist mostly as
a check on my impulses&ndash;when I want something I add it to the wishlist instead
of buying it. It feels almost as satisfying and I haven&rsquo;t spent any money. Every so
often I go through my wishlist to see if I still want the stuff on there. About 3/4
of the stuff gets eliminated, the rest I eventually buy. But since there&rsquo;s no
urgency, I like to find a good deal first, that&rsquo;s where CamelCamelCamel comes in.
They monitor everything I want and let me know when the price drops below a target
I&rsquo;ve set.</p>
