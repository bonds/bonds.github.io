<p>I suspect that if you take a somewhat random group of human beings
and ask them to organize themselves in order to
allocate work and limited resources, most of the time
they will find themselves playing a zero sum game with each other. I call
it the <strong>+1-1=0</strong> game.</p>
<p>The other game to be played is the <strong>1+1=4</strong> game. It&rsquo;s the game
of abundance, of creating a bigger pie, of win-wins that benefit everyone.
It&rsquo;s a lot harder to pull off.
It requires leadership and shared culture (which also requires leadership).
Our modern society is evidence it can be done.</p>
<p>Which game are you playing? At work? With your spouse? Which game is
your boss playing? Your boss&rsquo;s boss?</p>
