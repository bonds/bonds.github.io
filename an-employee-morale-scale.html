<h2>An Employee Morale Scale</h2>

<p>The scale goes from low to high morale. My biggest realization of the past five
years, related to morale, is how weak a tool high comp is for driving morale.
It can make people very happy for a short time, but after that it doesn&rsquo;t do
much on its own&ndash;the steady state for high comp (alone) is no better than the
&lsquo;passively looking&rsquo; step of the scale.</p>
