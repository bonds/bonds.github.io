<p><strong>Ken Writes:</strong></p>
<p><em>EA has updated the job board on their website. I&rsquo;ve uploaded my resume but when it shows up in the text box, a lot of my alignment is thrown off. Should I adjust it to fit the text box or leave it as it is in its MS-Word state? Which way will EA see it when I submit my resume?</em></p>

<p>Hi Kenbo, it might be easiest if you cut and paste your word document into Notepad and then format in that file. Once you have everything all lined up, you can then cut and paste your resume from the Notepad document without having to worry about formatting issues.</p>
