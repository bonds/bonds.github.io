<p><strong>What is the point of all this?</strong></p>
<p>This site exists to encourage and educate future EA employees about the roles and people of EA.</p>
<p>When I started looking into the game industry I couldnt find much guidance about how to make the jump coming from 10 years in another industry. So, I decided I would share my experiences and try to blaze a path for the next person. Much of the blog was written while I was in the middle of figuring out how to find a job with EA. I have since been hired by EA as a producer on an unannounced action-adventure game so the tactics I have used have at least worked once!</p>
<p><strong>Is there an IWantToWorkAtLucasArts.com too?</strong></p>
<p>No, there are no other sites (by me, at least) like this. But there is <a href="http://www.iwanttoworkforgoogle.com/home.html">this</a> site.</p>
<p><strong>I&rsquo;m from EA, what is it you are looking for?</strong></p>
<p>Shoot me an email to say! Be sure and let me know if you are interested in contributing your insights and stories about the industry&ndash;I&rsquo;m looking for other EA employees who can add another perspective and set of experiences to the site.</p>
<p><strong>I want to work at EA too! What should I do?</strong></p>
<p>Read this blog from the beginning. Really&hellip;it wont hurt too much. I&rsquo;ve done my best to pack it chock full of real conversations, notes, and strategies that I&rsquo;ve used to get a job at EA. Everything from how I met each person to what I was asked in interviews is in there. I&rsquo;ve also included books that I&rsquo;ve read, answers to questions that have been emailed to me, and updates about what I&rsquo;m doing now that I&rsquo;ve landed a job.</p>
<p><strong>What will happen to this site once you land a gig at EA?</strong></p>
<p>The original plan was to Dread Pirate Roberts this sucker and make the site available to someone else to steer around while <em>they</em> search for a gig at EA. I havent thought of a good way to actually do that, so the current plan is to evolve it into a place to answer questions about getting a job at EA, questions about the industry, and posts about the work of a producer.</p>
<p><strong>You quoted/misquoted me and I&rsquo;m afraid <em>they</em> will come after me!</strong></p>
<p>I dont want to misquote you and I absolutely do not want to get you in trouble! Just let me know where the troublesome quote is and I&rsquo;ll fix it or remove it&ndash;whichever is called for.</p>
<p><strong>I have an idea for a game&ndash;who can I talk to?</strong></p>
<p>This is a very popular question and Tom Sloper offers some <a href="http://www.discovergames.com/how2sell.htm">excellent advice</a>.</p>
