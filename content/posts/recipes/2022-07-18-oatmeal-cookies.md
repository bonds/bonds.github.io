# Lactation Cookies

Yield: makes about 20 to 22 cookies, depending on your scoop

Total Time: 45 mintues

## Ingredients:

3 cups old-fashioned rolled oats
1 1/2 cups unbleached organic *bread* flour
5 tablespoons brewers yeast
3 tablespoons ground flaxseed
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon salt
12 tablespoons organic unsalted butter
4 tablespoons unrefined organic virgin coconut oil
1 1/2 cups organic brown sugar
1 large egg + 1 large egg yolk
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups dark chocolate chips/chunks (I like ghirardelli)

feel free to add: unsweetened flaked coconut, chopped almonds, 1 to 2 tablespoons of almond butter

## Directions

In a large bowl, whisk together the oats, flour, yeast, flaxseed, baking powder, soda, cinnamon and salt.

In the bowl of your electric mixer, beat the butter and coconut oil on medium speed until creamy. Add in the sugar and beat on medium to high speed until fluffy, about 4 to 5 minutes, scraping down the sides of the bowl if needed. Add in the egg and egg yolk, beating until combined, about 2 to 3 minutes. Add in the vanilla extract and beat until combined again. Gradually add in the dry ingredients, beating on low speed until just combined and mixed. Stir in the chocolate chips with a spatula until they are evenly dispersed.

Scoop the dough into 1.5-inch rounds (I use an ice cream scoop so they are fairly uniform in size) and freeze overnight. When ready, place on a parchment lined baking sheet and bake for 18 minutes (starting with a cold oven) at 350F. Take out of the oven and allow to cool for 15 minutes before eating, giving the cookies time to solify.

## Appendix

1. You can easily freeze this dough - scoop the rounds on a baking sheet, place the sheet in the freezer for 2 hours, then place the dough rounds in a ziplock bag and store in the freezer. Bake at the same temp - they may or may not need an extra minute or 2 - your preference!

2. You can use all butter if you don't have/can't find coconut oil. If you swap any butter amount for more coconut oil, the cookies will spread a bit more. If you decrease the fat (butter/oil) amount in total, these cookies will be drier. It's up to you!

3. You can use 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour with similar results - any more and the cookies with be drier and grittier.

4. You can probably decrease the sugar by 1/4 cup without issue.

5. I do not have experience in making these vegan, so I can't say what it would be like without the eggs or with vegan butter. I also am not sure how the consistency would be with gluten free flour.

6. I personally think you can increase the brewers yeast amount by 1 to 2 tablespoons.
