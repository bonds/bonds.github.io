<p>I&rsquo;ve been pondering Hilary Clinton&rsquo;s <a href="http://brokehillary.com/">dead brokeness</a>, what she meant, and
what it means to be rich. Or rather, what a (more) useful definition might
be&ndash;one that could help predict (political) views and behaviors.</p>
<h3 id="scotts-definition-of-rich">Scott&rsquo;s definition of &lsquo;rich&rsquo;</h3>
<ul>
<li>top 1% of income</li>
<li>owns job and/or almost no chance of being fired and/or the loss of income
from being fired would <em>not</em> have a material impact on their lifestyle</li>
</ul>
<p>The rich and/or powerful own the system, they are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_user">root</a>, and for them the
system (the government, the law, the dominant corporations) is extremely
valuable and something to be preserved and exploited for their benefit.</p>
<p>The rest of us are <a href="http://tron.wikia.com/wiki/User">users and programs</a>&ndash;we are part of the system, but we
don&rsquo;t own it. Its usually helpful to us, but it can also turn against us, and
our ability to mitigate an attack (by root) is limited.</p>
<p>Bill Gates is rich and powerful. Marc Andreessen is rich. Hilary is powerful,
but not rich&ndash;she needs the income from her work to preserve her lifestyle.
Barack Obama is powerful, but not rich (before he became President he was
neither). Equipped with this definition I see some interesting patterns about
views on the NSA, Snowden, unlimited copyright, and a lot of other policies that
interest me and which I find myself on the other side from those that are allied
with or are themselves rich or powerful. Its a better predictor than political
party in a lot of cases.</p>
