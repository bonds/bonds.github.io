<p>Just got off the phone with Lisa Bell. The scoop is that they already have someone internal for the position&ndash;the post to EA jobs was really more of a formality. But, even though they dont have other production positions open, Lisa said she liked my resume and would like to speak to me in December. Were scheduled for a phone call 1st week of December. Pretty cool. Glad I made that phone call. :)</p>
