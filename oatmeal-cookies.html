<p>Makes about 15 cookies.</p>
<ul>
<li>3 cups old-fashioned rolled oats</li>
<li>1.5 cups bread flour</li>
<li>5 tablespoons brewers yeast</li>
<li>3 tablespoons ground flaxseed</li>
<li>0.5 teaspoon baking powder</li>
<li>0.5 teaspoon baking soda</li>
<li>0.5 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
<li>0.25 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>12 tablespoons organic unsalted butter</li>
<li>4 tablespoons unrefined organic virgin coconut oil</li>
<li>1.5 cups organic brown sugar</li>
<li>1 large egg + 1 large egg yolk</li>
<li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
<li>1.5 cups semisweet chocolate chips</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="directions">Directions</h2>
<p>In a large bowl, whisk together the oats, flour, yeast, flaxseed,
baking powder, soda, cinnamon and salt.</p>
<p>In the bowl of your electric mixer, beat the butter and coconut
oil on medium speed until creamy.
Add in sugar and beat on medium speed until fluffy,
about 5 minutes, scraping down the sides of the bowl if
needed. Add in the egg and egg yolk, beating until combined,
about 3 minutes. Add in the vanilla extract and beat until
combined again. Gradually add in the dry ingredients, beating
on low speed until just combined.
Stir in the chocolate chips with a spatula until they are evenly dispersed.</p>
<p>Scoop the dough into 1.5-inch rounds (I use an ice cream scoop so they are
fairly uniform in size) and freeze overnight. When ready, place
on a parchment lined baking sheet and bake for 18 minutes (starting
with a cold oven) at 350 F. Take out of the oven and allow to cool for
15 minutes before eating, giving the cookies time to solidify.</p>
