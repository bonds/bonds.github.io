<h2>AI is the 80 Percent</h2>

<p>AI solves the first 80% of a lot of problems for almost free and then the last 20% takes 10x vs what it would have if you had hand coded the whole project. AI lovers and AI haters talk past each other, because the lovers either make more money by convincing people of AI&rsquo;s awesomeness, or they are staying within the 80%, while the haters try using AI to solve a whole problem, see that it can&rsquo;t, see that it makes the whole solution more expensive, and question AI lovers&rsquo; motives.</p>
<p>The AI winners will be the AI makers that convert to other assets before the bubble bursts, and the AI users who figure out how to create significant value while staying within the 80% that AI&rsquo;s easily good at.</p>
