<h2>Stables and Volatiles: Goals</h2>

<p>First, if you haven&rsquo;t read <a href="http://randsinrepose.com/archives/stables-and-volatiles/">Stables and Volatiles</a>, go read it and then come
back.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m working on <a href="https://weekdone.com/resources/objectives-key-results">OKRs</a> this week and pondering whether objectives that require
&lsquo;just&rsquo; working hard are good enough, or whether our objectives should <a href="http://eleganthack.com/the-art-of-the-okr/">require a
miracle</a> to pull off. Let&rsquo;s say, for the sake of argument, one of our objectives
has a 10% chance of success if we work on it at a normal level and a 20% chance
of success if we bust our butts and pull off a couple brilliant moves. When my
team sees the goal, I imagine something like this going through their heads:</p>
<h3 id="volatile">Volatile</h3>
<p>That&rsquo;s a tough goal. But if we work together, we can double our chance of
success. And if we succeed it will be awesome! Plus, even if we don&rsquo;t succeed,
when we shoot for the stars, we&rsquo;ll at least hit the moon and that will be great
too. Let&rsquo;s do this!</p>
<h3 id="stable">Stable</h3>
<p>We will most likely miss that goal. And even if we all work extra hard, we will
still most likely miss that goal&ndash;chance plays the biggest role here. If I work
just hard enough to get full credit for participating and then invest some time
in an extra credit project, I can hedge: if we get lucky, we hit the goal and we
have my extra credit win too. If we miss the goal (as is likely) we&rsquo;ll at least
have my extra credit project as a win. If we miss the goal and my extra credit
project doesn&rsquo;t work out, at least I learned a new skill and had fun while
working on my extra credit project.</p>
<p>Volatiles seek glory and the chance at an interesting outcome. Give them Big,
Hairy, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Hairy_Audacious_Goal">Audacious Goals</a> and stand back. Stables seek high probability success.
Give them the chance to take an initiative from 90% to 99% probability of
success and stand back. Just don&rsquo;t confuse or mix the two or you&rsquo;ll end up
demotivating a lot of your team.</p>
