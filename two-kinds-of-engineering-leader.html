<p>When a software company is searching for a new CTO or VP of Engineering,
they tend to look for either a Chief of Surgery or a Head Coach. Hiring
the right (or wrong) one can mean the difference between success and
failure as a company. Knowing which you are can help you choose the
right opportunity.</p>
<p>The <strong>Chief of Surgery</strong> is one of the best, if not the best, software
engineer at the company. Often they are career engineers with limited
management experience. But for a small startup where getting the code
right is critical and the CTO is 1/4 of the development team, the CoS
offers a huge boost in productivity by setting coding standards,
establishing the architecture, drawing the technology roadmap, and
coding like crazy. Basketball equivalent: Michael Jordan.</p>
<p>The <strong>Head Coach</strong> is a former engineer who has spent years developing
their people, project, and communication skills in order to bring out
the best in their team. As a company grows and can count a number of
highly skilled engineers among its ranks, the engineering team will
usually include leaders who can help with coding standards and
architecture, but its up to the Head Coach to understand and grow
individual talent, to forge a team that&rsquo;s worth more than the sum of its
parts, and to partner with the rest of the organization so the company
builds the right software and achieves the best possible
results. Basketball equivalent: Phil Jackson.</p>
